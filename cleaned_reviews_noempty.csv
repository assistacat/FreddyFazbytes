Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),1,"i worked in a famous seafood restaurant in singapore where 90% diners came for chilli crab. came to try chilli crab in todak and we asked for 800-900gm crab. but when it was served, it looked much smaller than the requested size. it looked like 650-700gm only. i'm very certain they cheated on the weight of the crab.",Nikki Law

Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),1,"don't spend your money here ! ! paying superior price and get super low quality food. don't order crab here! - crab meat with slime - shell is big, once open up meat is smaller than anchovies - crab probably dying soon or already dead told front desk about it, they dont even bother to explain, only ask me how i want to make payment! spend rm410 for 2 pax lunch ! sucks food, bad experience, no service at all !! will update my review if i have any food poisoning issue",caely tham
Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),2,"been many times, but my recent visit just 2 weeks ago was a big disappointment! the crabs , 1 piece were nt so fresh, the fish was bad, as it was overcooked n texture was rubbery! the live prawns were not fresh at all as it was not caught live from the tank whn we were there! very dissatisfied n disappointed!! we feedback to e staff and they were totally defensive and dismissive, rather than offering an attempt to understand or address the issue. there was no effort made to offer an apology or a form of compensation which made our experience more frustrating. when we asked for some compensation in e form of some discounts on our total bill, the reply we got was , “we r just workers, the boss is not around”! what kind of attitude n standards of service is this??",Jen Chan

Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),5,was a little unsure about the reviews but was glad we made it. we arrived when it was low tide and as one other reviewer mentioned the garbage is exposed and the place looks dilapidated and filthy. however the restaurant itself is actually pretty clean including the toilet. the pricing is very reasonable and transparent. the seafood is very fresh and tasty. i did find the seasoning a little too heavy but overall happy with everything. will love to return.,Charlee November

Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),4,"i recently visited this restaurant. a spacious and clean seafood restaurant that serves no pork and no lard, making it suitable for a wider group of diners. the restaurant is located slightly inside the area, but it's worth the trip. they have a wide variety of live and fresh seafood to choose. all the seafood are market price. freshly catch and will be weigh in front of you. the food was great as always, which is why i visit regularly. i especially enjoyed the teochew steam fish and soy sauce prawn. prices are average and reasonable for fresh seafood. staff were friendly and attentive and service was good. a great place for seafood lovers—definitely recommended!",Andrew Lim
Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),1,"i was recommended this restaurant by a saloon and wanted to try out the seafood. when we got there it was low tide and it didn't look appealing at all with all the trash in the water. service was non existent, find your own seating was the theme. most of the staff were there to just carry or clear food and not much else. do not buy the satay or otah from one of the sub tenants. total garbage, otah was more flour and colouring and had barely any fish, satay meat was cheap frozen chicken or meat with a lot of greasy fat. i saw a lot of uneaten otah and satay sticks on many of the tables. price wise for 1.5 kg black pepper crab, mapo tofu, kang kong and some chinese lettuce came to rm360. which was expected for the quality. however, if you included the time to drive there, it's a barely pass if u're looking for cheap food, if you're expecting decent quality or service, give this place a wide berth especially if getting a grab out of there will take hours of waiting as it's far from the city.",Dylan Lee
Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),4,"reservation is a must, if not have to come earlier to find seats. best to come before sunset. seafood by the sea, very fresh seafood where u get to the items u want. must order the black pepper crab, steam fish, gam heong lala. you get to order satay too but by another vendor. the mutton satay is so good! overall a good place to dine with family. we had 1 chili crab, 2 black pepper crab, kam heong lala, steam fish, 2 vegetables, man tou + rice for 6 pax, total about rm945 including beer and drinks",MEY (Mochima)
Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),1,"one bite of the fish, and i felt like im under the sea.",Yun Yee
Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),3,"service is quite chaotic. u have to find yr own seats first.. then queue to order yr seafood. the place is full of mosquitoes so be prepared to be stung whilst dining. the road into the restaurant is quite bad.. quite sandy and not paved properly. at peak hours there is no parking available outside.. they don't use digital weighing scale to weight ur seafood and they weigh with the pail. so not very accurate. if u want to dine there, order the crabs and live sea fish.. the prawns are not live and some are mushy. the soya sauce for steaming the fish is too sweet.. overall not a very pleasant place to dine at",Jon Peng

Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),5,"the seafood here is super fresh and the portions are really big—great value if you’re coming with a group of at least 4 people. prices might seem high at first, but once you see the portion size, it makes sense. definitely recommend for seafood lovers who enjoy sharing dishes!",Angel Tam

Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),1,"the difference! apart from the difference, it’s still a difference! i haven’t made any progress after so many years. the crabs we ordered have died for a long time and are still smelly. we obviously lived when we chose it. as long as we know what magic we changed in their kitchen. . what's worse is the attitude of those employees. . we gave a report that they were not happy, thinking that we would complain after eating the smelly crab. i was speechless. later, i looked online and found out that we were not the first table to encounter this situation, but the store had no intention of making changes. . . awesome. . .",Kelyn _c

Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),2,"i came here after hearing so much about the place..it’s quite famous and the scenery is undeniably beautiful. but sadly, the food was a big letdown. the tom yam soup was really bad and totally unacceptable. the lemon chicken had no salt at all, very bland. we ordered two types of fish, the 3 rasa was way too sweet, and the ginger steam fish was just average. no fruit juice available either. honestly, it’s not worth the money. you’re paying for the view, not the food. won’t be coming back",kriatini ranjan

Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),4,went with some friends. really enjoyed the deep fried sea bass. it was so fresh and tasty. also enjoyed the spicy prawn dish (forgot the name). the prawns were succulent and sweet. however the drunken prawns were a disappointment. the gravy tasted like plain water with a little hint of rice wine while the prawns weren’t as good as the first prawn dish. likely to come again with my family.,Joanna Peck

49 SEATS,4,"what we had: lunch set (11.30am to 5pm) - starter, main dish and drinks - $17.90 1. tom yum seafood pasta visual: 4.5 5 taste: 4.5 5 creamy, spicy, and tangy — the taste and quality have been consistent for years. this is my go-to dish every time i’m here. i’ve tried tom yum pasta from other places, but this one’s my favorite. the amount of seafood is impressive too — i’m not even a big seafood fan, but i always manage to clean my plate. chef’s kiss. nothing bad to say about it :) 2. cheesy chicken chop visual: 4.5 5 taste: 3.5 5 generous portions — the plate was bigger than we expected! lots of crispy fries and coleslaw to go around. unfortunately, the chicken sauce tasted more like pizza sauce, giving it a pizza-on-chicken vibe. it lacked depth and the “wow” factor was mostly from the portion size. we probably wouldn’t order this dish again. 3. cheese fries (ala carte $9.90) visual: 4 5 taste: 4 5 looked awesome and tasty! best to share with more than two people — we couldn’t finish it all and appreciated that the restaurant was happy to provide takeaway boxes. it’s a bit pricey, but when shared among a group, the cost is manageable. plenty of sauce, both cheese and mayo — loved it! tip: visit during their lunch hours for the set meal — it’s definitely worth the price then!",Jehu Limang

Colony,4,"hi team, this is was my 3rd time here overall…and my first time for my mom. overall, the food was great!!! however, i noticed the snowcrabs had a very salty taste and not as fresh as my first two times… prawns were great as usual… out of curiosity, why were the crabs salty last night?",inflextion leslie
Colony,5,"rethish, arvin, tin & ning ning has been really fabulous and super awesome in service. they completed the meal experience and i totally appreciate the attention and the constant pampering. kudos to colony and the standard that you uphold both in terms of service. cocktails can be expanded in terms of variety and options.",Davin Tan
Colony,5,"what's to say, but the utopian buffet experience can only be had at the ritz carlton sunday champagne brunch. from fresh seafood to curated cocktails, you'll be sure to get a bang for your buck if you visit on sunday for their brunch. most buffets claim spreads, but the colony sunday brunch promises quality of the spread. only here can you get bespoke service, where they encourage and entice you to try their 3 cocktails, 2 champagnes, red and white wines, and at least 4 fruit drinks, including the different waters from sparkling to distilled. and if you're lucky to get ningning, you've won the lottery for the day. she's the sunshine of the colony, and brings you warmth and a personal touch that makes you feel like you've got your personalised butler service. don't worry about changing plates, or getting wet ones, or cutlery to dig out the delicious crab. she'll get them for you, and with a smile. thank you, ning ning, for a memorable brunch. we come back because of excellent service from people like you. a shout out to tin, rethish, and angie as well. you're the stars of colony.",dt seluj

Colony,4,"airy, upscale hotel eatery with 7 open kitchens, plus a la carte meals & a generous global buffet. the colony buffet at the ritz-carlton is generally considered a top-tier buffet experience in singapore, known for its diverse and high-quality food, elegant ambiance, and attentive service. we were invited for dinner by a friend of ours. loved the ambience service and food. two guys at the pasta section ,took good care of my dietary requirements when i told them make ravioli for me. they were careful about not adding onions and garlic etc i liked it. the guys at the pizza section didn't want to make any pizza when i requested for a vegetarian one,not sure what's the point of having a live station catering to diner's needs. they just pointed at a few slices on display which didn't look appetising, so i moved to pasta section. desserts and fruits were fresh. at the other sections, food was being replenished in time. indian food section was untouched,looked full except diner going for mutton and tandoori chicken. couldn't take photo of the food,will capture it next time. as a vegetarian who doesn't take onion and garlic,there were some options for me like salads, breads, pasta etc. couldn't find any vegetarian soup as both the soups which were available had meat in it. loved the architecture. it is wheelchair accessible. buffet dinner at colony (sundays to thursdays) available from sunday to thursday from 6 p.m. to 10.30 p.m.the dress code is smart casual. slippers and activewear are not permitted. covered shoes are required for gentlemen. thank you for the top tier dining experience.",Ms. Suchi Singapore

Colony,2,"the space especially the sushi section , the walkway so narrow and the snow crab and seafood section also kinda narrow. i have eaten many buffet oversea n locally. this the only one i found they dun even wash or clean the oyster shell. most of the oysters i took the shell all have sands like never wash beside they peel open. not a good experience on a 5stars hotel can improve on it and most oysters in hotel i eaten they have prepare and it's nicely off the meat from the shell. and during the buffet i have diarrhea need to rush for wash room . 1st time i having diarrhea dying a buffet section same with my friend who i treated him for his birthday dinner. the jackfruit on fruits section is a plus point. mention: the fried hokkien mee is surprisingly delicious with wok hei.",Casey Khoo

Colony,4,"first time trying this place, recommended by friends. we purposely came on friday night where they served seafood buffet. understand sun-thurs may have some 15% discount for certain credit cards, but no discount on fri and sat. basically, there are 3 main section of food, the desserts, the cold dishes and the cooked food (together with fruit juices and fruits). i must say the selection of food is great, but considering the price per pax vs quality , i give it a 4-star only. some of the food item is quite disappointing, such as the lobsters, al of us concluded the sauce taste funny, and we had to specially asked for it without sauce. the oysters and crabs are fresh though. the environment is nice and cosy, but t think they placed too many tables, resulting the walkway between tables are narrow and can be dangerous when you move with hands full of food. i give it a 4-star. the staff are friendly and helpful but they lack of some product knowledge, and we had some hard time checking on discounts, and almost needed to avoid our payment. 3 of us paid for $425 plentiful of parking at the hotel car park and they do give complimentary parking ticket.",Chris
Colony,5,"went for buffet lunch today and i must really praise all the staff for their top notch services and attention.the colony's atmosphere is good, not noisy even though is full house and space in between tables is not cramp. though the buffet ended at 2.30p.m., the staff allow us to sit till 6p.m. before their dinner commencement. really appreciate their kind gesture and thoughtfulness. the international buffet has a good range of dishes to choose from. the cold prawns and crab are really fresh likewise for the sashimi. if you like ""hum full"" laksa, this is the place for it. lemak gravy which has the old school taste. thanks for the good experience today. reservation recommended.",Kckcchuo@gmail.com Kckcchuo

Colony,5,"on the last day of summer vacation in singapore, i was looking for singapore food and accidentally found a colonie buffet. really lucky, i went to the gs60th anniversary firecracker event near ritz carlton on the day of the reservation. as soon as i entered, my name was so kind to the server called lee lee, and it was my first trip to singapore. so i couldn't remember the real name. he would introduce the food culture properly and brought a little bit of food from various chefs and chefs. the food is so colorful, delicious and beautiful as it is multinational! i was curious about the crab that i couldn't eat until the last day, but yong wei chef introduced the crab dish and tasted a huge crap. and because of the coloni with a lobster, chef sanghyuk brought a lobster grilled with plenty of mozzarella. it was a nice korean! so you can explain a little more detail :) and hui jun, who gave me a lot of fresh oysters and shrimp mussels, richard chef who tasted baked ducks, danish chef who informed real singapore satte, who had eaten really delicious, was so delicious, colorful and not coming. i praised it. it was a very happy time to find out all these situations and food that i didn't know and to know singapore better. oh, if you go to the salad corner, hui jun is doing food like a singapore salad called rojack, but i was really delicious and impressive. i want you to eat it for mixing peanuts and vegetables and fruits. if you eat it, it is singapore conquer! the quality of the food and the service are too best, so colonie also said that it was a hotel buffet, and even though it was a hotel buffet, so many people used so many people to know why the reservation was so full. until i came to singapore, i didn't really expect it, but i wanted to come back to singapore again by meeting the friendly and friendly singapore coroni staff who informed me of food culture. if you come to singapore, i will stop by. thank you!",BOYEONG LIM

Colony,5,"visited colony on 12 july 2025 with the wife. after making a reservation, i was contacted by one of the staff and advised that i could arrive earlier if i wished to so that i would have more time for my dinner. of course, i gladly obliged and changed my reservation to an earlier time. upon arriving at colony, the wife and i were seated promptly by their manager and a server immediately came to our table and explained the place to us. service was impeccable; plates were cleared fast, serviettes were replenished before we finished those given and lemon water and scissors were brought to us minutes after my server noticed that we had taken crabs prawns. as we were slightly into our dessert, a birthday cake was brought to our table unprompted; a level of attentiveness that surprised us. the food was great but the oysters that night were sandy and unfortunately gave my wife a stomachache the entire night. atmosphere was as what one would expect from a higher-end buffet although i found the seats were too close to each other.",Sam

Colony,5,"tried a number of hotel buffets in singapore and got to say this one is most worth the money spent. my favourite is the japanese cruisine bar, sashimi thickly sliced, sushi rice was nicely seasoned and fluffy, not hard like rice cakes. the oysters were fresh and plump, decent size! prawns fresh too so easy to peel, none of them were mushy. dessert bar so amazing, literally wished i left tummy space for this. we all know lots of hotel buffets dont care about dessert selection as long they look good but taste like cupboard cakes from some random factory, but colony has dessert that you know are definitely crafted with care!",Bimbles

Colony,5,simply the best sunday brunch in terms of quality of food hands down. the seafood which comprise of premium lobster and alsaska king crab is the best in singapore. yes its very expensive at $228++ but you get quality and goes with great service. it's a real treat. i ate here at least once a month and never been dissapointed.,Yue Huan Lee

Lighthouse Bistro,3,"i have dined at lighthouse bistro for nearly 20 yrs. it used to have a members 4 course lunch month at a discounted price . however since covid, not only the quality but also the format for the member's lunch changed. now it is a 3 course lunch offered at a higher price. i visited the place a few days ago & was very disappointed by not only the quality but also the quantity of the offerings. the main dish was very reduced in quantity & the dessert was 1 2 of what it used to be. the saving grace -is that the service is still very good. they added a new dish -plant based meatless burger which is terrible as the patty was ""dry"" & made out of mushroom & soya! (not like the beyond meat burger). overall a disappointing bistro now. lighthouse bistro has been a nice restaurant in the past. but since jan2023, standards have dropped & it has now become an average restaurant. the prices have been raised steeply, the ""members"" monthly menu reduced from 4 course to 3 course, quantities dish portions reduced & overall quality average. further the place has only two stereotyped veg dishes- pasta & fried rice for a number of years & it seems the management is ""oblivious"" of the changing tastes worldwide, where these days all restaurants in west have atleast 25%-30% veg dishes in the menu! further all restaurants in west have no hallal but only veg, nonveg dishes..unlike in singapore...where vegetarians are forced to accept what is available..however mediocre the dishes & quality are. restaurants like lighthouse bistro should have more variety & courses for vegetarians , compared to non vegetarians as vegetables cheaper than meats & more healthy.",C S S Rao

Lighthouse Bistro,5,"the food was amazing, the mushroom soup was a great starter. the seafood platter enough for 4 people to share was awesome, prawns, muscles, squid & battered fish stick was a beautiful way to start the meal. the came the ribeye steak, juicy, succulent, tender & flavourful and accompanied with fries....oh lala!! if that was not enough, my wife and i had anglehair mee goreng which, was piping hot and a must have. never thought that this would taste so nice but trust me it did. infact, every dish we had was lovely. been sometime since we ate at a place that all the dishes we ordered was soooo nice. to top it off, the service staff was first class, professional, attentive, warm and a shout out the ken. ken's the man, he provided an amazing service throughout dinner. thank you ken. you can be sure i'll recommend this wonderful place in all aspects to anyone asking for a great restaurant. oh yes and the price is not gonna make you fall off your chair. it is reasonable, fair and worth the money. an amazing restaurant, soft music, a place fit gir dignitaries....provided they don't mind it not being in the heart of orchard...hehe!!",Schoen Karl
Lighthouse Bistro,5,"i recently celebrated my friend’s birthday dinner at lighthouse bistro, and it was an absolutely delightful experience from start to finish! our server, ken, provided top-notch service, attentive and friendly. the food was nothing short of spectacular. the sous vide ribeye was cooked to perfection, tender and bursting with flavor, while the scallop pasta was executed flawlessly, with every bite a savory delight. the sea perch stood out too, beautifully presented and seasoned just right. and the truffle fries? they arrived in a generous, towering mountain, fried to crispy perfection and infused with that irresistible truffle aroma. the drinks were expertly crafted and paired wonderfully with the meal. overall, it was a fantastic night filled with great food, impeccable service, and a warm atmosphere. lighthouse bistro made the celebration truly memorable!",Goh WL

Colony,1,food quality dropped a lot. some of the seafood are not fresh especially the crab and snow crab. prawns are still alright. roast meat sections lousy meat are very oily and the taste is not right. roast duck taste blend. char siew the spice taste is too strong. lots of msg cos i am very sensitive to it and felt thirsty after the dinner. compared to pre covid-19 era which is much better. only stuff that i find it nice is the laksa and mango passion fruit sorbet. but service is top notch,Adrian Wee
Colony,4,"good variety and quality of food, very fresh oyster and shrimp. love the pork rib,nice flavor.will come again",Audrey
Colony,3,"the oyster (big n plump) and salmon sashimi (seafood sweet) are good n fresh. understand that they had switched their oyster supplier to the us. previously the oyster was just average. good management decision to switch to a better supplier that provides big n deep based oyster. i had eaten slightly over a dozen for my weekday dinner buffet. the snow crab claws pincers was tasty with seafood sweetness. i don't usually eat snow crab as it can be really messy n may chip off your teeth. but i certainly enjoyed the snow crab claws! the plain water were served without any slices of lemon. incredible service for this highly rated hotel. anyways the staff had quickly served on a small plate a few slices when i made the request. the service staff were attentive to take away side plates when these were full including the wrapping of the japanese chopsticks. very professional guys. kudos to all of you for making my dining experience at colony god in this aspect. some were chatty as they engaged us in small talks. as for the other foods, the choices are pretty limited n tasted just average. should revamp the types of dishes to give these an atas taste as well as look n feel. there was no udon or ramen or cold noodle at all! just unbelievable!!! the sushi were so hard n not placed in a mini fridge after these were made. how to preserve the freshness of japanese sushi!!! these are coming from me who is a lay person in f&b. the honey comb was pathetic n barely sweet and tugged away in an inconspicuous corner that i missed out until my wife told me!!! promised to replace my small bottle of honey to go with my camomile tea but one of the caps was so tight even the waiting staff n my strong n young son cannot even open it). the bottle of honey unfortunately was forgotten by the waiting staff n we had to share those bottles that were opened. the chinese food especially the roasted duck n char siew are so average n the soup (black bean) was so disappointing. dim sum was very disappointing n the attitude of the chef making the chinese noodle for a hotel like riltz carlton was wanting n lack professionalism!!! pastas n indian food offerings were slightly above average. overall, i don't get good vibes for my the dining experience here n maybe because i had previously made several visits before. hardly any glamour n let alone looking forward to yet another visit. buffet at pan pacific (although rated as one star lower) had alot of offerings. really good value for the food. maybe i had a better experience there. may have to look for a good alternative given my last experience at colony that was not great at all except for the oyster n salmon sashimi",David Wong
Colony,1,"parasites found in fresh oysters i have emailed your establishment in jan 2025 to formally express my concern following a dining experience with multiple parasites found in oysters. unfortunately, i have not yet received a response. during our meal, i selected three oysters from the rack and immediately noticed a large parasite swimming inside one of them (approximately the size of half a strand of spaghetti). i was shocked and shoved the plate to your staff, who acknowledged the issue. subsequently, i was assured that three new oysters would be provided. i inquired whether these had been thoroughly checked to ensure they were free from any parasites, and your team confirmed they had been inspected. however, upon consuming one of the replacement oysters, i observed a parasite swimming inside again. this recurrence is deeply concerning and raises serious questions about the sourcing and handling of your seafood",Amy Chang
Colony,5,"this was definitely one of the best buffet i have tried so far. the buffet offers a variety of different food of different taste and style. for example, there is indian, chinese, japanese and american food. my personal favourite is the sashimi from the japanese section and bread from the bread section. there was also free flow juices to drink from. however, as i am a kid and i love sweets and gummies, i was a bit let down by the desserts in the desserts section. there was too little toppings for the ice cream toppings and there was no sweets. there was also no chocolate fountain and marshmallows. (no hate) the service was great, the staff is warm and friendly. they always clear the plates and pour water in our cups when there is no more water left. overall, i think this was a good buffet and i hope it can improve on the dessert section.",Cayli Yong

Colony,1,"came here to dine with my family twice. on the third time, everything seemed fine until the food. my brother's girlfriend felt off after eating the oysters and i myself have the runs after eating their food. don't know whether it is the seafood or what. other than that, the previous times the service was good but our waiter make some comments about us like ""somones thirsty"". i understand the jest but i dont really think it is an appropriate setting to make such comments. other than that, we ordered two pots of chamomile tea, but the same waiter got our orders wrong and served us two chamomile tea and an earl grey tea. really hope it was an off day for this place as i really like to come here.",Liew Kenyun

"SANDO at Alexandra Technopark (Japanese Sandwiches, Coffee, Craft Beer... some say Burgers too.)",5,"i ordered one fish and one beef brisket. the fish is really nice and isn't drowned in sauce. i would prefer the beef brisket to be even softer. i find the price reasonable, based on the quality and quantity. the place was clean and comfortable. the service was great, too. do note that they close at 2:30 p.m., but the last order is at 2 p.m.",Sleepy Sleeping

"SANDO at Alexandra Technopark (Japanese Sandwiches, Coffee, Craft Beer... some say Burgers too.)",4,"pork katsu was great, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, nicely elevated with the citrusy sauce. beef brisket (slices) can be a little tough, fatty parts could be a little more rendered to give a more consistent texture. sweet and sour sauce was an attempt at kimchi flavours, able to cut through the meaty taste. portions were reasonable for the price paid, will be back to try other items when around the area.",Marcus Ang

"SANDO at Alexandra Technopark (Japanese Sandwiches, Coffee, Craft Beer... some say Burgers too.)",5,"worth the a visit! chillax location on a saturday morning without noisy patrons. easy parking within atp itself. add on a walk at hort park (side gate has direct access to atp). warm and friendly service. reasonable prices compared to other sando places which charge high $20s. here the sandwiches are net prices and mostly under $17. we had: 1. beef brisket - flavorful, enjoyed it lots 2. hoki fish - fish was over fried to a hard crisp. it was just ok 3. spam-o - thick slab of spam and hash brown. can’t go wrong with this combo 4. flat white, cappuccino - good cuppas breakfast sandos +$3 for a sizeable portion of tater tots. will absolutely return again for a chill, tasty and value meal.",HY F

"SANDO at Alexandra Technopark (Japanese Sandwiches, Coffee, Craft Beer... some say Burgers too.)",4,"if you are a fan of sandos, you can enjoy fairly good tasting ones in a cafe which is rather awkardly nestled in a very office area. the parking signage is pretty bad for someone who is unfamiliar with the area and entered the sheltered carpark instead. really difficult to get lots in the sheltered carpark, so turn up towards the slope which leads to an open-air carpark. see my parking tips. while the tonkatsu sando and crispy chicken wingettes were well-flavoured, i was super thirsty within an hour after the meal. the bun was also rather underwhelming, and seemed to taste like normal bakery buns. perhaps their donburi would be better, which wouldn't match the name of the café! for coffee, the spanish latte tasted average. the mild aroma of the coffee beans is good for those who do not want to return to the office with strong coffee breath!",Avril Atkeg

Hua Yu Wee Seafood Restaurant,5,"an old family favourite in the east, this restaurant has been a weekend staple for years. for some strange reason, we would willingly squeeze in with the crowds, just like many other families. reservations are highly recommended, almost mandatory. it used to be far more chaotic, but they have now streamlined their processes with three dinner seatings: 5:00pm, 6:30pm, and 8:00pm. if you are in the first slot, parking is usually available. for later slots, be prepared for the traffic jam outside the restaurant before being able to hand your car over to the valet. once inside, everything runs like clockwork, as long as you manage to catch the attention of the waitstaff. if not, you risk wasting precious minutes from your 1.5 hour dining time, as dishes do take time to arrive. the atmosphere is incredibly lively, ranging from crying babies, the occasional semi-tipsy uncle, and the chatter of families over food. as for the menu, our staple includes the coffee ribs, black pepper beef cubes, prawn rolls, vegetables with shark cartilage broth, and of course, the crabs. we usually go for the chilli crab, which tastes more tomato than chilli, but is already spicier than elsewhere. the black pepper crab is a strong contender, though it can be a bit too pepperish at times. all in all, a good place for family dinners, but if you would prefer to avoid the crowd, consider going on a weekday before 6:30pm.",MH Tham

Hua Yu Wee Seafood Restaurant,4,"seafood very fresh. only issue is, every staff is so busy and no one to provide directions or help to take orders or clear tables. eg. when we first arrive at the carpark, it was unclear that we needed to go through right to the back and 'catch' a willing staff to show us to our table (with reservations). they forgot about my baby chair which i did indicate during reservation so imagine the fluster with one adult getting the highchair and trying to clean the chair and other to ensure baby doesnt struggle too much. we had to wave very hard to grab a staff attention to take our orders. food is served relatively fast though. when i want to make payment, i couldnt find a staff so i walked up in front and was asked to sit back at my table for someone to assist.",C W

Lighthouse Bistro,2,"impeccable but slow service, food was well curated but tasted too sweet, probably using bottled pasta sauces and also too watery, and cocktails looked nice but badly mixed. mee goreng using angel hair was a very bad choice. too sweet and pasta very soggy, had to throw away as too sweet to eat. sotong was like rubber. can’t recommend though waiter was superb and polite though he kept missing our table’s requests. prices are high for bistro, and food worse than hawker quality.",Chinese Moon

"SANDO at Alexandra Technopark (Japanese Sandwiches, Coffee, Craft Beer... some say Burgers too.)",1,"13 december. i tried the brisket, fish and beef patty burgers. burger buns were average. fish is real fish meat with some ""fishiness"". beef patty was weird that was deep fried with some batter . brisket was the worst . it was like steamed slices of meat with fats that made it really hard to chew. all the burgers had its own distinctive sauce that didn't really go well together as a burger. portion was big though. i felt that probably there was some fusion somewhere but the sauces, meat and buns didn't go well together.",Wei Meng Tay
"SANDO at Alexandra Technopark (Japanese Sandwiches, Coffee, Craft Beer... some say Burgers too.)",5,"ordered the menchikatsu sando and oh my word it was an absolute thing of beauty! the moistness, crunch and juicyness of that menchikatsu is in a world of it's own. the balance of the pickles and sauce gives the sando that tarte flavour that cuts the grease of the katsu. not forgetting the cheese melted inside the katsu. although an eastie myself, this sando place is one worth travelling to the west for! sando 5+ 5 -- honestly think this might be the best sando place in singapore period.",Christian Villanueva

Lighthouse Bistro,5,"a little small restaurant tucked away at a corner outside lavender mrt. but dem the food and service is really good! got the platter, the fish is battered nice, prawns fried nicely, the mussels taste so good with the sauce but whatever the sauce is (think it's garlic something) mixed with the squid is so dem good, ya can dip the fries or anything in it and it will be good! the calamari with buttermilk cream is very good too, it just meshes very well with the buttermilk sauce. next up is the classic lamb shank, ok this is an all star. firstly the meat is superbly tender, secondly there is no gamey taste of lamb and thirdly the sauce brings everything including the potato mash and veggies together so well. lastly is the lava cake and ice cream for desert, both paired very well with each other, the creaminess of the ice cream and the savoriness of the choc lava cake. would i come again to try their other dishes, sure definitely looking at you mr sou vide ribeye steak. haha",Sim Kylar

Fiamma,3,"the service at fiamma is top-notch, upholding the reputation of capella hotels worldwide. our server was attentive, noticing dietary preferences we didn’t communicate, and was knowledgeable about the menu. the staff also gave two desserts for my mother’s birthday, as they noted some of the guests didn’t like cheese. however, the food is where fiamma fell flat. we had started off strong, with meatballs and búfala cheese as the appetisers, and they were fantastic. the mains left much to be desired, with the pasta being overcooked to the point of mushiness, and the seafood unfortunately was not the freshest. thank you to fiamma staff, who made the experience enjoyable nevertheless. it goes to show that service can save what would’ve been a gastronomical nightmare.",Abby Ng

Fiamma,4,"we had a wonderful dinner at fiamma, and the food was a true highlight of our stay. the tomahawk steak was cooked perfectly to a tender, juicy medium rare that melted in the mouth. the blue lobster was fresh, and the pasta was cooked to perfection — though for my personal taste, the sauce was a touch too creamy. the tiramisu was outstanding, with freshly made cream that was light yet indulgent. service was excellent — the wait team was warm, professional, and incredibly accommodating, making the experience feel polished and welcoming. the only downside was the small flies that joined us throughout the meal when seated outdoors, which was a little distracting. i’d recommend choosing an indoor table for a more comfortable experience, and i do hope the restaurant can address this, as everything else was truly exceptional.",Ankori

Mellben Seafood,3,"crab was good and that’s the only good thing. we ordered 10 dishes, the clam was dry, the fried chicken coating was thick, and the cereal prawn had an overly sweet flavor. i would recommend here if you only order crab and set lower expectation for rest of dishes.",Siliang Liu
Mellben Seafood,5,"first day in singapore and went to mellben for an early dinner to beat the crowd. there are 3 crab meals you need to try but we can only order 1 so we started things off with the popular claypot crab bee hoon soup. you can select the weight of the crab depending on availability. got the signature deep fried homemade beancurd and scallops & asparagus with xo sauce for some greens. a cold bottle of beer seems right for the moment. you can get a glass of water for free but adding ice will cost you a little. the beancurd which measure 3x1x1 is huge and chunky with a crispy texture on the outside but soft and chewy on the inside. its really good and a must try. the soup from the claypot carb is so rich and tasty, its almost a meal on its own. probably good if paired with a cup of rice to soak up all the juice. its one of the best crab meal i ever had in singapore and i still haven't tried the spicy or butter crab meal yet. payment is made at the counter after you're finish. cash payment instead of card will get you additional discount. digital payment not accepted here. inside the restroom washing area is a picture wall of diners who forgot to pay and just walked away. such a shame as this is such a great place to have a crab meal. staff are so helpful and efficient so lets all play fair. as mellben is located on the lower floor of an apartment residential block away from the orchard strip... travelling here is a 20 to 30 minute taxi ride. getting back is harder even if there's a bus route nearby. best option is to book on a ride-sharing or taxi app. truth be told.... after having this delicious crab meal everything is now downhill at this point. a queuing booth in front of the store tells you that despite its a big restaurant will lots of seating area... there's quite a wait during peak so try to come early and avoid the big crowd. if you have read my review up to this point.. its a must-visit. bring a couple of friends and order the clay pot, butter and spicy crab trifecta. a few bottles of cold beer and there you have... a very satisfying if not the best crab meal in town.",DanAGo

Fiamma,1,"when the blue lobster pasta first came, we got a whiff of a strong pungent smell coming from it. we still gave it a shot only to realise the pasta had a really fishy smell and taste to it. furthermore, the lobster meat itself was incredibly mushy like a paste, probably lobster that was not fresh. we expected the lobster meat to be fresh and firm as we’ve never tried lobster meat this mushy and bad. afterwards we enquired from the man wearing a blazer, he told us that the pasta sauce was broiled with lobster shells and heads, thus the smell. (however the smell was more unpleasant rather than fragrant.) he also said that the lobster meat was “intentionally cooked this way” to be mushy… (not sure if well cooked lobster meat is supposed to be so soft that turns into a paste as i’m under the impression that fresh lobsters generally have a slightly more firm and pleasant texture) the man also did not seem open to receive feedback from us on how we feel about the pasta so we did not want to continue talking to him about it.",Lululu

Lighthouse Bistro,3,"came over for dinner and ordered their signature lamb shank and souve ribeye steak. firstly when we enter, we caught the whole staff resting. they were all surprised to see us. thankfully their response was prompt and professional so a plus! service was impeccable and efficient. everything was done right from service to accessories for dining. price wise was also on the affordable side and menu has a good variety. portion sizes were good too except for the sauces which were given sparingly. taste wise was okay but not impressive enough for a star. their signature lamb shank was disappointing as the texture was rough and powdery. meat was too dry for my liking. souve ribeye steak was nicely medium rare and the crust was done right. except for the cut may be too lean for my liking and also too much tendons within the meat. so no star here. ambience was good and seatings were spacious. everything was fine and we enjoyed the dining experience except for the meat took us a long while to chew. overall a good 3 star rating and towards the 4 star. hopefully the signature dishes get some improvement and same for the ribeye.",Scott Ng

"SANDO at Alexandra Technopark (Japanese Sandwiches, Coffee, Craft Beer... some say Burgers too.)",4,"before i write the rest of this review, i need to get the bad points out of the way. this place is so damn far inside alexandra technopark, if you weren't already hungry you would have become hungry because of the walk in. secondly, when i am paying so much for the food and beverages, i have to still return the dishes, even though the place was empty. that being said. i loved the sando. it was so so good and i loved the criss cut fries, and their craft beer selection was great too, they stock things you dont regularly see. just loved the food and drinks. painfully i have to strike off a star from my rating because of the service. the food was just so good. and in terms of location... i guess you can't do much because it targets the staff of atp.",Brandon Wong
"SANDO at Alexandra Technopark (Japanese Sandwiches, Coffee, Craft Beer... some say Burgers too.)",5,"although the original menu i fell in love with is gone (rip, kabocha-halloumi sando), chong and the crew at sando never fail to serve up comforting, delicious sandwiches and sides with innovative flavours, and an excellent coffee and beverage selection. their bread is easily my favorite i’ve had in any sando ever, and their monthly specials and pop-up events keep things exciting even when you’ve made your way through the menu as many times as i have. it’s clear this is a business run with passion and love — and i’m sure you’ll want to support this friendly neighbourhood sandwich shop regularly too, if only you can brave the trip to the slightly inconvenient location the first time.",Angad Srivastava
"SANDO at Alexandra Technopark (Japanese Sandwiches, Coffee, Craft Beer... some say Burgers too.)",5,"awesome sandwiches. the menu (and price) has changed many times over the years. i would recommend going for the portobello sando without any balsamic veg dressing and add an egg, just to replicate the “mushroom trio” on the old menu which was a personal favourite.",Yulong Wang

Fiamma,1,"went for dinner and had some wine last night at fiamma. there were two bottles of red wines we took some time to finish. at 10.30pm, one of the male servers rushed to clear my empty glass without if it was appropriate to do so. the glass that was cleared was for a different red wine, and there was some wine left in the bottle (it’s for a nero d’avola), the existing glass i had was for a brunello di montalcino. i understand that the restaurant needs to close by 10.30pm but there is no need to be hasty about it. when i asked if i could sit outside for a short while and finish up my wines, i was given a negative answer and the glasses and wines have to be cleared. no one checked on us to see if we could be made more comfortable by having our wines being corked and taken away in a carrier bag until we asked for it. for a restaurant in an exclusive hotel like capella, the service is rather appalling. what would have been a good night out was left with a slightly bitter aftertaste. jerry gwee, iws, sws, fws (p.s. there is only one standard sized wine glass for white wines. bigger reds like barolos, super tuscans, brunello di montalcinos, chianti classicos all deserve wine glasses with bigger bowls for the wines to breathe and showcase their aromatics well. standard sized wine glasses detract from the experience of enjoying these wines, especially when they are priced high.)",Jerry Gwee

Fiamma,5,"my experience at fiamma wasn't just a meal; it was a deeply cherished moment shared with my mother. the extensive menu offered a delightful array of choices, and the staff were incredibly kind and patient. they gently guided us, offering personalized recommendations, even explaining the loving care that went into each dish's preparation. the food itself? it transcended mere sustenance; it was an experience. each bite felt infused with homemade warmth and genuine passion. i especially remember the polpette—tender meatballs brimming with herbs and spices, served with a rich, flavorful sauce—a taste sensation i'll long remember. a huge thank you to vinci bartol, kumar, bastian, chef antonio, and chef lim for making this such a special occasion for my mom and i. it's an experience i'll treasure forever.",Aaliyah Zaid

Mellben Seafood,5,"this was by far the best chilli crab i’ve ever had! i even ordered a second portion because it was that good. the crab was fresh, the flavor was outstanding, and the fried mantou made everything perfect. price-wise, it’s quite affordable by singapore standards — i spent around $300 for 4 small crabs, along with mantou and tofu, which comfortably fed four people. tip: be sure to call ahead and make a reservation to avoid long waiting times — it gets busy! i’ll definitely be back for another visit! nearest mrt: marymount",Jessica Natania

Mellben Seafood,1,"i am a very fair person. the food is honestly good. however the service and restaurant policy is rubbish. so for this reason we are giving them 1 star review. we were there on 2nd april 2025, for dinner at 730 pm. we were a 2 pax party. we wanted to order 2 different cooking styles of crab. the staff told us that each crab has to be above 1kg for them to cook one dish. the staff told us to select our own crab. we selected a crab that was 900g, almost 1kg. he said they cannot cook the dish if the crab is less than 1kg. he told us to reselect the crab. he refused to select the crab for us. he insisted we select the crab ourselves. we ended up selecting 2 crabs that weigh 2.8kg. for 2 pax, this is a lot. however we were very hungry so we decided to just go ahead with it. we brought a bottle of wine, and our own wineglasses. the restaurant wanted to charge us corkage of $12. the crabs for 2 pax was $330. we felt that as a goodwill gesture it would have been nice if they waived the corkage for us, given that we brought our own wineglasses. we decided to order their house wine which costs $50. the staff served this wine and did not even bother to bring wine glasses for us! frankly we were so fed up that we decided to just enjoy the food and make this the last visit here. even though the crab dishes were good, the service and restaurant policy really left a bad taste in our mouth. we definitely won’t be back here again.",Dr Wee Lyn Teh

Jai Thai,2,i was at the clover way last night and one of the dishes i ordered was the pineapple fried rice which i usually order. to my surprise the rice were all clumped and tasted like an overpowering turmeric rice with a few thrown chicken slices and countable pineapples. will definately give it a miss.,Helen
Jai Thai,4,"all dishes were very flavourful but may be bordering to salty if not taken with rice. pandan chicken was a must order, clear tom yum soup perfect taste and the tapioca with coconut milk was just right. minced chicken in basil leaf was a rice stealer (but quite oily at the end) along with the green curry chicken, stir fry kangkong had too much sauce and appeared a tad salty if not taken with rice.",Kgirl 001
Jai Thai,4,"first time there, all dishes were very flavourful. the pandan leaf chicken was nicely grilled and clear winner, the tom yum clear soup was just the right taste (not too sour nor sweet), the green curry chicken looked oily when served but had greate taste and good amounts of vege, the minced chicken basil leaf was a little oily (best taken with rice else salty), the fried tilapia fish sauce was a little sweet but otherwise good, the stir fried kangkong could have been a little less salty else all were rice stealers. the red ruby was perfect (not too sweet) although the pieces mango felt a little dry. the cendol had a bit too much coconut cream and a tad sweet. but overall was a satisfying meal. would come again with family",Kgirl SG
Jai Thai,4,"food standard varies, some days good some days not good. i ordered ผัดกระเพราไก่ basil with chicken and fried kangkong. i asked for less salty but the foods were still too salty for me. however, the fried egg was dripping with oil and overly deep fried with charred edges. foods here are reasonably tasty but not exactly the best or authentic thai food as most reviewers claimed.",Mandy
Jai Thai,5,"great and affordable thai food located in a landed enclave. will recommend the crab cake, pad thai for sure. will be back to try other dishes. parking lots is limited. about 10-15mins walk from bishan mrt. only suggestion is to throughly clean the chair and tables as i saw some stains on the chair.",Travis Lim

Jai Thai,4,authentic thai food at decent prices. great chendol drink.,Kenneth Cheong
Jai Thai,3,decent offerings but not as the signboard says. it's halal so fans of basil pork rice will have to go for basil chicken instead. and it doesn't come with an egg. their tom yum was still good. get the red one. i was surprised they don't offer the iconic thai lime steamed fish. they only have a fried version which was strange. pandan chicken was a little dry too.,Uncle Tan
Jai Thai,4,"ordered 4 dishes. kai lang, panang dried curry chicken, tom yum chicken clear soup and fried beef with pepper garlic for $40. the taste of the dishes are superb. however the quality of the meat was so bad that i cannot over look. chicken of tom yum was the worst offender. it was just so tough. beef has too much tendon and the stuck in between teeth. dry curry chicken was barely average. kai lang was great. taste wise tom yum was quite authentic which beef was great. the goat was the dried curry chicken, it was so coconutty one of the most flavorful sauce.",Super Fragrance
Jai Thai,5,"food tastes great! ordered the set meal which comprises of a papaya salad, crab cake, sweet sour chicken, fried whole fish, mixed vegetable and tom yum seafood soup. unfortunately we couldn't wait to take pictures before finishing the food.",Terence

Jai Thai,1,"we had a disappointing experience at jai thai restaurant. the somtam we ordered was not well-prepared; the fish inside was undercooked. when we informed the waiter, he offered a replacement, but by then, the issue had already ruined our appetite for the entire meal. we didn't accept the replacement nor were we offered a refund. while we appreciate the gesture, the lack of quality control in the first place was unacceptable. this experience has left us hesitant to return.",jove tan

Jai Thai,4,place look basic but the taste is not too bad pineapple fried rice got the taste and not too bad. tom yum clear soup normal spicy got kick prawn cake is not bad though i feel abit greasy the pandan chicken i find it so so only though it’s signature. it’s abit hard m flavor so so the kangkong is avg,M P
Jai Thai,5,"delicious food, authentic thai people like us considered to be able to use it. but still not trying papaya salad, there is a chance to try",Patcharaporn Suphannon
Jai Thai,5,the standard is still as high as it was 6 years ago! their red curry & basil chicken dishes are a must try!,Tryphena
Jai Thai,5,huge and clean place for family. you are greeted when you enter the place and immediate given a seat with ipad for ordering. the online menu also have option for less spicy if there is chilli in the dish. potion of each dish are huge and taste good. only concern is its hard to find parking in the area as its locate in landed enclave. recommend to drop by if around the area,Steven Soo
Jai Thai,4,"looking for authentic thai food, look no further. recommeds the fried fish, prawn cakes , veggie ,tom yum gong soup, pineapple fried rice, thai milk tea and fried egg.",Andy Chua
Jai Thai,5,food is consistently good with many choices of yummy thai food at affordable prices. winnie makes us all feel welcome and at home everytime we are at the restaurant. outstanding staff with terrific service. highly recommend for food and atmosphere.,Ellena Lew
Jai Thai,4,food is delicious but for takeaway it is ridiculous. the absolute smallest container size. $9.50 for the thai basil chicken rice in the smallest container possible (about 1 3 the size of your standard tze char box) is a scam. it's about 60% of the amount of small for dine-in.. boss please correct this - won't be a return customer because of that.,Mr A
Jai Thai,5,"this place is a gem for anyone who loves thai food! we had the pad thai, and it was hands down the highlight of our meal. super flavorful and tasted authentic! we also went with a set menu that came with pandan leaves wrapped chicken (which was super unique and so good), fried fish, a single spring roll, and green curry. everything was tasty, but that pandan chicken really stood out for us. honestly, for what you get, the price is totally worth it. the food is good, and it won’t break the bank. definitely recommend this spot if you’re in the mood for some solid thai food!",Hui Ming Chiak
Jai Thai,5,"great food, intimate family style restaurant. green curry is a must try. would also recommend the pineapple rice.",Kai
Jai Thai,2,i’ve been eating at this place for close to 10 years and it’s really authentic thai. the food is great but the decor could use a refresh. parking is also terrible at this location so try to beat the crowd if you can! another bad thing is the ordering system. staff will make noise for sending multiple orders! unfriendly staff always deserves a bad rating.,Eric Lee
Jai Thai,5,food is amazing for it's price! had thai basil rice with green milk tea and it was great highly recommend!,Tyler Tan
Jai Thai,5,shop location would be inconvenient if not driving. parking lots around the restaurant are limited too. ordered the thai basil rice and tomyam soup. portion is good for its price and both of them are delicious! tomyam soup tasted similar to the one i had in bangkok. would recommend to any thai food lovers!,Jessica Chua
Jai Thai,4,food is consistently authentic and flavourful. it is however disappointing that they cannot afford serviettes. they used to have tissues at a central table which diners have to take themselves. now even that is no more. i have to think that i have paid cafe prices and got coffee shop service.,Angela Chua

Jai Thai,5,"i recently stumbled upon a thai restaurant while searching for a lunch spot, and i was pleasantly surprised by the food. although the portions were a bit small, the prices were very affordable. i tried the salted fried rice, a platter where the prawn cake was the standout, and the clear tom yum soup—though i asked for it to be less spicy, it still packed quite a punch but tasted delicious! for dessert, i had chendol and red ruby, both rich in coconut flavor and very enjoyable. overall, the food was flavorful, affordable compared to other thai restaurants, and definitely worth the visit.",M F

Jai Thai,4,affordably priced authentic thai food. food was slightly salty but the portion and ingredients was generous. highly recommend pandan leaf chicken and platter. tom yum soup was flavourful with 5 pieces of prawn. definitely worth a try!,Zhi Le Tan
Jai Thai,4,"very hidden n secluded restaurant which is more for the landed area. happened to find as i was looking for thai food in the area. limited parking and i was lucky to get 1 within 5 mins. probably around 10 lots max n i guess. u need to park further or at those industrial buildings nearby. old rustic feel which hasn't been renovated for years. chairs felt abit shakey due to age i guess. ok for the food. misses for the prawns which was hard and not fresh. beef was just as bad due to the hardness, dry and sad feel. will skip these 2 if i order again. prawn cakes, pandan chicken and sotong were very good. thumbs up for these. fresh tender and nice. omelette was nicely done as well but then again, rarely do you get this dish wrong isnt it. service was good and it seems most were thais. very crowded on this sunday evening, full house in fact. price wise - indeed as per what their signboard rave but also do note of the portion size. its mostly on the small size.",Ars 3276
Jai Thai,3,quite nice thai food and reasonable price...,Ho
Jai Thai,5,"never disappoint me. always forgot to give review as the restaurant is near my office. for the past two years, their standards maintain. and i have also brought many friends there too. don’t be mistaken by the simple look of the dishes. today i decided to take photos to post as i really appreciate them always letting us order food when we reach almost at 830pm and the restaurant will close soon. food is always tasty and love the tom yum with lots of original ingredients. have tried all their desserts also yummy. tang hoon texture is great and with lots of ingredients too. please keep up the standard.",A T
Jai Thai,1,"food very poor quality- its only redeeming feature is not so expensive. however there are much nicer places at similar price. beef was tasteless and quite chewy, cashew chicken was mushy mess not crispy or tasty, nothing good to say about fish, green curry was too creamy and sweet.",Carl Ward

Jai Thai,5,"love how there was ample space between each seating area. the service was great, everyone was friendly and clarified any questions we had. food was delicious, green curry a tad sweet, tom yum soup was great ! both were set meals, green curry was upsized, so was the rice that came with it. good portion for 2. the fried egg was crispy and fluffy upon serving. however the mango sticky rice was not what we expected. rice was not as fragrant as we had hoped for. the milk tea was your standard yummy thai milk tea. we also ordered a ruby red drink, pretty refreshing with coconut milk and coconut water with thin slices of jackfruit in it. this was part of the set whereby you had to add on $2. overall, very satisfied with the meal and price point.",Raven D

Haci'nin Yeri - Yigit Lokantasi,5,we went to marmaris with my wife for a holiday. we chose this restaurant as a place for dinner based on the reviews and because we wanted juicy food. when we first went there was a serious queue. you proceed by taking the food you want in the form of an open buffet. both vegetable dishes and meat dishes were plentiful. there was also dessert for those who wanted it. after you get what you want you pay at the cashier. they don't go through cards they work in cash. there was a lot of food variety. and the food prices were unbelievably cheap. we paid only 84 tl for all the meals here. it included buttermilk and bread. but unfortunately i can't say it's too clean as a place..,Gulsum Akar
