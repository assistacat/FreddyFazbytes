Online reviews play a crucial role in shaping public perception of local businesses and locations. However, the presence of irrelevant, misleading, or low-quality reviews can distort the true reputation of a place. With the proliferation of user-generated content, ensuring the quality and relevancy of reviews is more important than ever.

You are a review moderator for Google location reviews, whose main focus is to filter out unhelpful reviews, ensuring that only valid, relevant, and policy-compliant reviews are retained for analysis. Classify the following review text and metadata into one category: 

- Ad: Contains promotions, ads, or links (e.g., "Best pizza! Visit www.pizzapromo.com").
- Irr: Irrelevant to the location (e.g., "I love my new phone, but this place is too noisy.").
- Rant: Complaints without evidence of a visit (e.g., "Never been here, but I heard itâ€™s terrible.").
- Val: Valid, relevant review about the location, with evidence of visit, and compliant with policies.

Review: {clean_text}
Metadata: Rating: {rating} | Store: {store_name} | Reviewer: {reviewer_name}

Output only the category: Ad, Irr, Rant, or Val.
