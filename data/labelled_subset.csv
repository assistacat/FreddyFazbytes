The Live prawns were NOT fresh at all as it was not caught live from the tank whn we were there! Very dissatisfied n disappointed!! We feedback to e staff and they were totally defensive and dismissive, rather than offering an attempt to understand or address the issue. There was no effort made to offer an apology or a form of compensation which made our experience more frustrating. When we asked for some compensation in e form of some discounts on our total bill, the reply we got was , “We r just workers, the boss is not around”!

The restaurant is located slightly inside the area, but it's worth the trip. They have a wide variety of live and fresh seafood to choose. All the seafood are market price. Freshly catch and will be weigh in front of you.  The food was great as always, which is why I visit regularly. I especially enjoyed the Teochew steam fish and soy sauce prawn.

"I was recommended this restaurant by a saloon and wanted to try out the seafood. When we got there it was low tide and it didn't look appealing at all with all the trash in the water.  Service was non existent, find your own seating was the theme. Most of the staff were there to just carry or clear food and not much else.  Do not buy the satay or otah from one of the sub tenants. Total garbage, otah was more flour and colouring and had barely any fish, satay meat was cheap frozen chicken or meat with a lot of greasy fat.  I saw a lot of uneaten otah and satay sticks on many of the tables.  Price wise for 1.5 kg black pepper crab, mapo tofu, Kang Kong and some Chinese lettuce came to RM360. Which was expected for the quality.  However, if you included the time to drive there, it's a barely pass if u're looking for cheap food, if you're expecting decent quality or service, give this place a wide berth especially if getting a grab out of there will take hours of waiting as it's far from the city.","{""rating"":1,""store_name"":""Restoran Todak (Orang Asli)"",""reviewer_name"":""Dylan Lee""}",Val

They don't use digital weighing scale to weight ur seafood and they weigh with the pail. so not very accurate.

"What we had:  Lunch Set (11.30am to 5pm) - Starter, main dish and drinks - $17.90  1. Tom Yum Seafood Pasta Visual: 4.5 5 Taste: 4.5 5 Creamy, spicy, and tangy — the taste and quality have been consistent for years. This is my go-to dish every time I’m here. I’ve tried tom yum pasta from other places, but this one’s my favorite. The amount of seafood is impressive too — I’m not even a big seafood fan, but I always manage to clean my plate. Chef’s kiss. Nothing bad to say about it :)  2. Cheesy Chicken Chop Visual: 4.5 5 Taste: 3.5 5 Generous portions — the plate was bigger than we expected! Lots of crispy fries and coleslaw to go around. Unfortunately, the chicken sauce tasted more like pizza sauce, giving it a pizza-on-chicken vibe. It lacked depth and the “wow” factor was mostly from the portion size. We probably wouldn’t order this dish again.  3. Cheese fries (ala carte $9.90) Visual: 4 5 Taste: 4 5 Looked awesome and tasty! Best to share with more than two people — we couldn’t finish it all and appreciated that the restaurant was happy to provide takeaway boxes. It’s a bit pricey, but when shared among a group, the cost is manageable. Plenty of sauce, both cheese and mayo — loved it!  TIP: Visit during their lunch hours for the set meal — it’s definitely worth the price then!","{""rating"":4,""store_name"":""49 SEATS"",""reviewer_name"":""Jehu Limang""}",Val

"A Hidden Gem for Fusion Pasta Lovers! 49 Seats never disappoints! I came for the famous Tom Yum Seafood Pasta and it absolutely lived up to the hype — rich, creamy, spicy, and packed with fresh seafood. The Smoked Duck Pasta was another highlight — tender, flavorful, and surprisingly well-balanced.  Service was friendly and attentive, and I liked the chill industrial-style decor — cozy enough for a casual date or gathering with friends. Prices are reasonable given the portion sizes and central location.  Would highly recommend if you’re looking for something different from your usual Western or Asian fare.

"What's to say, but the utopian buffet experience can only be had at the Ritz Carlton Sunday champagne brunch.  From fresh seafood to curated cocktails, you'll be sure to get a bang for your buck if you visit on Sunday for their brunch. Most buffets claim spreads, but the Colony Sunday brunch promises quality of the spread.  Only here can you get bespoke service, where they encourage and entice you to try their 3 cocktails, 2 champagnes, red and white wines, and at least 4 fruit drinks, including the different waters from sparkling to distilled. And if you're lucky to get NingNing, you've won the lottery for the day.  She's the Sunshine of the Colony, and brings you warmth and a personal touch that makes you feel like you've got your personalised butler service. Don't worry about changing plates, or getting wet ones, or cutlery to dig out the delicious crab. She'll get them for you, and with a smile.  Thank you, Ning Ning, for a memorable brunch. We come back because of excellent service from people like you.  A shout out to Tin, Rethish, and Angie as well.

"Airy, upscale hotel eatery with 7 open kitchens, plus a la carte meals & a generous global buffet. The Colony buffet at the Ritz-Carlton is generally considered a top-tier buffet experience in Singapore, known for its diverse and high-quality food, elegant ambiance, and attentive service. We were invited for dinner by a friend of ours. Loved the ambience  service and food. Two guys at the Pasta section ,took good care of my dietary requirements when I told them make Ravioli for me. They were careful about not adding onions and garlic etc I liked it. The guys at the Pizza section didn't want to make any pizza when I requested for a vegetarian one,not sure what's the point of having a live station catering to diner's needs. They just pointed at a few slices on display which didn't look appetising, so I moved to Pasta section. Desserts and fruits were fresh. At the other sections, food was being replenished in time. Indian food section was untouched,looked full except diner going for mutton and tandoori chicken. Couldn't take photo of the food,will capture it next time. As a vegetarian who doesn't take onion and garlic,there were some options for me like salads, breads, pasta etc. Couldn't find any vegetarian soup as both the soups which were available had meat in it. Loved the architecture. It is wheelchair accessible. Buffet Dinner at Colony (Sundays to Thursdays) Available from Sunday to Thursday from 6 p.m. to 10.30 p.m.The dress code is Smart Casual. Slippers and activewear are not permitted. Covered shoes are required for gentlemen.

"The space especially the sushi section , the walkway so narrow and the snow crab and seafood section also kinda narrow. I have eaten many buffet oversea n locally. This the only one I found they dun even wash or clean the oyster shell.  Most of the oysters I took the shell all have sands like never wash beside they peel open. Not a good experience on a 5stars hotel can improve on it and most oysters in hotel I eaten they have prepare and it's nicely off the meat from the shell.   And during the buffet I have diarrhea need to rush for wash room . 1st time I having diarrhea dying a buffet section same with my friend who I treated him for his birthday dinner.  The jackfruit on fruits section is a plus point.
