"how can you call your carbonara a carbonara when you drown it in a ton of cream and your sauce is not even that good, the meat is not even guanciale and it looks like some ham looking meat if it was bacon i could still say that its okay but no weird meat inside, there was nothing in the carbonara that i can even justify and say that its good and its 20 dollars. im sorry but i cant say its good","{""rating"":1,""store_name"":""49 SEATS"",""reviewer_name"":""Brian Yeo""}",Val
"ordered the carbonara seafood. sauce is creamy enough and there is plenty of clams in the pasta dish. however, the pasta is on the pricier side... after gst, almost all of their pasta dishes will cost more than 22 dollars... i also felt a bit thirsty after eating the food.","{""rating"":4,""store_name"":""49 SEATS"",""reviewer_name"":""Hong GZ""}",Val

"went with some friends. really enjoyed the deep fried sea bass. it was so fresh and tasty. also enjoyed the spicy prawn dish (forgot the name). the prawns were succulent and sweet. however the drunken prawns were a disappointment. the gravy tasted like plain water with a little hint of rice wine while the prawns weren’t as good as the first prawn dish. likely to come again with my family.","{""rating"":4,""store_name"":""Restoran Todak (Orang Asli)"",""reviewer_name"":""Joanna Peck""}",Val
"the seafood was really impressive! the crab was fresh and the meat was tender and sweet. the tiger prawns were also very fresh, with a firm and juicy texture. the butter squid was rich and flavorful — perfectly cooked! we also had the chili sweet potato leaves, which added a nice spicy kick to balance the meal. overall, a satisfying and delicious seafood feast","{""rating"":5,""store_name"":""Restoran Todak (Orang Asli)"",""reviewer_name"":""魔鬼中的天使""}",Val

"what we had: lunch set (11.30am to 5pm) - starter, main dish and drinks - $17.90 1. tom yum seafood pasta visual: 4.5 5 taste: 4.5 5 creamy, spicy, and tangy — the taste and quality have been consistent for years. this is my go-to dish every time i’m here. i’ve tried tom yum pasta from other places, but this one’s my favorite. the amount of seafood is impressive too — i’m not even a big seafood fan, but i always manage to clean my plate. chef’s kiss. nothing bad to say about it :) 2. cheesy chicken chop visual: 4.5 5 taste: 3.5 5 generous portions — the plate was bigger than we expected! lots of crispy fries and coleslaw to go around. unfortunately, the chicken sauce tasted more like pizza sauce, giving it a pizza-on-chicken vibe. it lacked depth and the “wow” factor was mostly from the portion size. we probably wouldn’t order this dish again. 3. cheese fries (ala carte $9.90) visual: 4 5 taste: 4 5 looked awesome and tasty! best to share with more than two people — we couldn’t finish it all and appreciated that the restaurant was happy to provide takeaway boxes. it’s a bit pricey, but when shared among a group, the cost is manageable. plenty of sauce, both cheese and mayo — loved it! tip: visit during their lunch hours for the set meal — it’s definitely worth the price then!","{""rating"":4,""store_name"":""49 SEATS"",""reviewer_name"":""Jehu Limang""}",Val

"a hidden gem for fusion pasta lovers! 49 seats never disappoints! i came for the famous tom yum seafood pasta and it absolutely lived up to the hype — rich, creamy, spicy, and packed with fresh seafood. the smoked duck pasta was another highlight — tender, flavorful, and surprisingly well-balanced. service was friendly and attentive, and i liked the chill industrial-style decor — cozy enough for a casual date or gathering with friends. prices are reasonable given the portion sizes and central location. would highly recommend if you’re looking for something different from your usual western or asian fare. will definitely be back to try the salted egg pasta next!","{""rating"":5,""store_name"":""49 SEATS"",""reviewer_name"":""Leslie Ng""}",Val
