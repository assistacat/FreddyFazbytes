"Resturant price, hawker center quality (the bland ones), not recomended.The food taste here have no depth, I ordered the marinara seafood pasta and the tomato paste taste like its from a can. The shrimp also taste not fresh. The chicken chop also have too much MSG, like other comments here, its very salty.  Nice environment tho.",Val

地点和环境是真不错，可惜食物每次都有点失望disappointed_face,Val
Delicious foods! My friends and I were having a good time here. All the food that we ordered was yummy. face_savoring_food will come back for more!,Val
We went for dinner. Busy as always. But still serve food at right time. They cook vegetarian food also.,Val
Good food. Service depends on how crowded. No menu.  You need to know what you want to eat.  Evening meals are better as you can sit next to the sea.  Getting there without a car is challenging.,Val
超级烂服务，尤其华人服务员的态度都非常不友善！欠他们几百万酱紫！再来食物自己没介绍好menu，怪顾客自己点错，一句道歉sorry也没有.点了5样食物，来了两碟，等吃完了才来另外两碟，吃完又来最后一碟face_with_rolling_eyesface_with_rolling_eyesface_with_rolling_eyes四周还一股臭味扑鼻thumbs_downthumbs_downthumbs_down,Rant
"I worked in a famous seafood restaurant in Singapore where 90% diners came for chilli crab. Came to try chilli crab in Todak and we asked for 800-900gm crab. But when it was served, it looked much smaller than the requested size. It looked like 650-700gm only. I'm very certain they cheated on the weight of the crab.",Val
This is my first try and the last food. The food is bad. I won't recommend it to my friends.,Rant
"Went for lunch today , ordered a crab and a red leopard grouper with 2 bottles of beer . Total coat RM415 for 2 pax . Crab was terrible wrong due to only shell and not fresh , is totally not from what i picked from the display tank . Fish was ok taste and no complaints. Not the first time visit but this might be the last time . Totally disappointed and not worth the time and effort travel there for such a dishonest restaurant.",Val
Come early before sunset for dinner if you want fresher & tastier seafood. Lesser crowd as well. Service was decent. Overall experience was satisfying & affordable.,Val
"Don't spend your money HERE ! ! Paying superior price and get super low quality food. Don't order crab here! - crab meat with slime - shell is big, once open up meat is smaller than anchovies - crab probably dying soon or already dead Told front desk about it, they dont even bother to explain,  only ask me how I want to make payment! Spend RM410 for 2 pax lunch ! Sucks food, bad experience, no service at all !!  Will update my review if I have any food poisoning issue",Val
"Been many times, but my recent visit just 2 weeks ago was a big disappointment! The crabs , 1 piece were nt so fresh, the fish was bad, as it was overcooked n texture was rubbery! The Live prawns were NOT fresh at all as it was not caught live from the tank whn we were there! Very dissatisfied n disappointed!! We feedback to e staff and they were totally defensive and dismissive, rather than offering an attempt to understand or address the issue. There was no effort made to offer an apology or a form of compensation which made our experience more frustrating. When we asked for some compensation in e form of some discounts on our total bill, the reply we got was , “We r just workers, the boss is not around”! What kind of attitude n standards of service is this??",Val

"Nice place nice food, price a bit costly but seafood very fresh and many variety to choose. Must order curry prawn",Val
"food bad , waitress bad 1 5",Rant
Crab is nice. The rest of the dishes are average.,Val
The food is ordinary and not very delicious. I saw dead crabs in the basket. I don’t know if it was cooked for customers. The service attitude is very poor. I can’t call it. I can’t get it. I didn’t take it seriously. I can’t call it. I can’t call it. I don’t recommend it. There is still a choice next door that is not his room. Then it’s very dark pink. I can’t see the food. . .,Val
Love the food and the environment at night for dinner.,Val
Was a little unsure about the reviews but was glad we made it. We arrived when it was low tide and as one other reviewer mentioned the garbage is exposed and the place looks dilapidated and filthy. However the restaurant itself is actually pretty clean including the toilet. The pricing is very reasonable and transparent. The seafood is very fresh and tasty. I did find the seasoning a little too heavy but overall happy with everything. Will love to return.,Val
"I recently visited this restaurant. A spacious and clean seafood restaurant that serves no pork and no lard, making it suitable for a wider group of diners.  The restaurant is located slightly inside the area, but it's worth the trip. They have a wide variety of live and fresh seafood to choose. All the seafood are market price. Freshly catch and will be weigh in front of you.  The food was great as always, which is why I visit regularly. I especially enjoyed the Teochew steam fish and soy sauce prawn. Prices are average and reasonable for fresh seafood.  Staff were friendly and attentive and service was good.  A great place for seafood lovers—definitely recommended!",Val
"I was recommended this restaurant by a saloon and wanted to try out the seafood. When we got there it was low tide and it didn't look appealing at all with all the trash in the water.  Service was non existent, find your own seating was the theme. Most of the staff were there to just carry or clear food and not much else.  Do not buy the satay or otah from one of the sub tenants. Total garbage, otah was more flour and colouring and had barely any fish, satay meat was cheap frozen chicken or meat with a lot of greasy fat.  I saw a lot of uneaten otah and satay sticks on many of the tables.  Price wise for 1.5 kg black pepper crab, mapo tofu, Kang Kong and some Chinese lettuce came to RM360. Which was expected for the quality.  However, if you included the time to drive there, it's a barely pass if u're looking for cheap food, if you're expecting decent quality or service, give this place a wide berth especially if getting a grab out of there will take hours of waiting as it's far from the city.",Val
"Reservation is a must, if not have to come earlier to find seats. Best to come before sunset.  Seafood by the sea,  very fresh seafood where u get to the items u want.  Must order the Black Pepper Crab, Steam Fish, Gam Heong Lala.  You get to order Satay too but by another vendor. The mutton Satay is so good!  Overall a good place to dine with family.  We had 1 chili crab, 2 black pepper crab, kam heong lala, steam fish, 2 vegetables, man tou + rice for 6 pax, total about RM945 including beer and drinks",Val
"one bite of the fish, and i felt like im under the sea.",Val
"Service is quite chaotic. u have to find yr own seats first.. then queue to order yr seafood.  The place is full of mosquitoes so be prepared to be stung whilst dining.  The road into the restaurant is quite bad.. quite sandy and not paved properly.  At peak hours there is no parking available outside..  They don't use digital weighing scale to weight ur seafood and they weigh with the pail. so not very accurate.  If u want to dine there, order the crabs and live sea fish.. the prawns are not live and some are mushy.  the soya sauce for steaming the fish is too sweet.. overall not a very pleasant place to dine at",Val
"The seafood was absolutely wonderful. For 16 pax, we split into 2 tables and ordered similar dishes for both tables.  - Hotplate tofu - Drunken prawn soup - Fried baby squid - Kungpao chicken - Sambal kang kong - Garlic kai lan - 20 pcs of shelled scallops in total - Big head lala - 1.5kg red grouper - Fried crayfish  Some drinks included",Val
"The road leading to the restaurant is kind of rough. Have to drive slowly as there are pod holes along the way. Food is nice. We ordered baby kailan, drunken prawn and 2 medium size crabs. We chose the crabs to be cooked in black pepper and chilli. The black pepper is very tasty. Whereas the chilli crab taste so so. It is different from the Singapore chilli crab style. The sauce is more watery. Taste kind of like tom yam. Drunken prawns are fresh. Customer service was OK. Atmosphere is OK. The restaurant is on a platform stretches out into the coastal area. Pricing is OK.",Val
"thumbs_up The seafood here is super fresh and the portions are really big—great value if you’re coming with a group of at least 4 people. Prices might seem high at first, but once you see the portion size, it makes sense. Definitely recommend for seafood lovers who enjoy sharing dishes!",Val
Since 2002 loyal customer to this restaurant but the taste of the food not like last time.,Val
"We arrived at around 5pm for an early dinner so not much crowd. Love the view overlooking Sembawang Park. Though, we were kinda disappointed because we were not advised on the weight of the seafood we chose before it was cooked. Staff also recommended an alcoholic dish despite knowing there was a Malay patron without informing that dish used cooking wine.",Val
"The difference! Apart from the difference, it’s still a difference! I haven’t made any progress after so many years. The crabs we ordered have died for a long time and are still smelly. We obviously lived when we chose it. As long as we know what magic we changed in their kitchen. . What's worse is the attitude of those employees. . We gave a report that they were not happy, thinking that we would complain after eating the smelly crab. face_with_spiral_eyes was speechless. Later, I looked online and found out that we were not the first table to encounter this situation, but the store had no intention of making changes. . . Awesome. . .",Rant
"The food taste has improved since the last time i been there.. the previous time several months ago was a disappointment. Pricing is ok. Paid RM300 total for steam fish (750gm), curry prawns, fried eggs, veg, hor fun and 3 beers for 4 pax.",Val
"I came here after hearing so much about the place..it’s quite famous and the scenery is undeniably beautiful. But sadly, the food was a big letdown. The Tom Yam soup was really bad and totally unacceptable. The Lemon Chicken had no salt at all, very bland. We ordered two types of fish, the 3 Rasa was way too sweet, and the ginger steam fish was just average. No fruit juice available either.  Honestly, it’s not worth the money. You’re paying for the view, not the food. Won’t be coming back",Val
"The food is fine, the food is not marked",Irr
"The three sweet potato leaves have stones inside. The store later changed a new plate. The sand pot and tofu on it later had iron wire frowning_face. It was a disappointing experience. The key orders were all the employees who looked like they were the boss. Improper. The crab said 158. If you choose, it was 178.",Val

The best tomyum pasta! Known them.since the kreta ayer days!,Val
"after many years, it never fails!",Val
Love the tomyum pasta,Val
Nice atmosphere and food.,Val
"how can you call your carbonara a carbonara when you drown it in a ton of cream and your sauce is not even that good, the meat is not even guanciale and it looks like some ham looking meat if it was bacon i could still say that its okay but no weird meat inside, there was nothing in the carbonara that i can even justify and say that its good and its 20 dollars. im sorry but i cant say its good",Val
"Ordered the carbonara seafood. Sauce is creamy enough and there is plenty of clams in the pasta dish.  However, the pasta is on the pricier side... After gst, almost all of their pasta dishes will cost more than 22 dollars... i also felt a bit thirsty after eating the food.",Val
"Big portions of food, value for money.",Val
"Cool vibes, interesting food choices!",Val
"Had a great dining experience at 49 Seats! The food was delicious, especially their signature pasta dishes. Cozy atmosphere, friendly staff, and reasonable prices. Definitely a spot worth revisiting!",Val
Cheap and good seafood.  Value for money. Will be back.,Val
Cheap but pay more for fresher array of seafoods. Long waiting during meal times. No availability of dinning tables.,Val
"Quite cheap to eat Seaafood especially crabs. Kamheong tastes good, but I don't prefer her egg sambal crab. Parking is wide and if many people are a little fierce. You can see view of Sembawang Industrial Area Very close one",Val
The  place  is amazing  the staff is highly  alert and the atmosphere  is welcoming,Val
"Revisited this place after 20+ years, still just as popular! Great to see it’s stood the test of time.  Chope ur table first, table number is painted on the floor, queue at counter to place your orders.",Val
Went with some friends. Really enjoyed the deep fried sea bass. It was so fresh and tasty. Also enjoyed the spicy prawn dish (forgot the name). The prawns were succulent and sweet.  However the drunken prawns were a disappointment. The gravy tasted like plain water with a little hint of rice wine while the prawns weren’t as good as the first prawn dish.  Likely to come again with my family.,Val
"The seafood was really impressive! The crab was fresh and the meat was tender and sweet. The tiger prawns were also very fresh, with a firm and juicy texture. The butter squid was rich and flavorful — perfectly cooked! We also had the chili sweet potato leaves, which added a nice spicy kick to balance the meal. Overall, a satisfying and delicious seafood feast",Val
"Lots of rubbish strewn over the car park and under the walk way to the restaurant. Other than crabs, the rest of the food doesn’t taste good.",Val
"The Lobster is amazing, and the crab is a must-try. 200% would recommend you to go if you were in Johor Bahru.",Val
Very packed. Have to wait 30 mins for table. Good food.,Val
"If you want LIVE seafood and at reasonable price, try here! Value for money :)",Ad
I think the food here is bad. Sometimes the taste will run away. The service attitude is bad. The serving is slow. They cook randomly. The taste is different every time. The price is expensive.,Rant
Nice dinner at the seafront,Val
Food is affordable and nice. Best of all no service charge:),Val
"We were really hungry and found this place on Google. Honestly, when we arrived, the restaurant turned out to be way better than how it looks in the photos. The food was absolutely delicious, and the service was 5 stars. Highly recommended! We even posted photos before and after to prove just how tasty it was!",Val
"Delay with meal , accidentally given to another guest. When arrived it was only warm . Spoke with manager who apologized",Val
the experience was excellent,Val
"What we had:  Lunch Set (11.30am to 5pm) - Starter, main dish and drinks - $17.90  1. Tom Yum Seafood Pasta Visual: 4.5 5 Taste: 4.5 5 Creamy, spicy, and tangy — the taste and quality have been consistent for years. This is my go-to dish every time I’m here. I’ve tried tom yum pasta from other places, but this one’s my favorite. The amount of seafood is impressive too — I’m not even a big seafood fan, but I always manage to clean my plate. Chef’s kiss. Nothing bad to say about it :)  2. Cheesy Chicken Chop Visual: 4.5 5 Taste: 3.5 5 Generous portions — the plate was bigger than we expected! Lots of crispy fries and coleslaw to go around. Unfortunately, the chicken sauce tasted more like pizza sauce, giving it a pizza-on-chicken vibe. It lacked depth and the “wow” factor was mostly from the portion size. We probably wouldn’t order this dish again.  3. Cheese fries (ala carte $9.90) Visual: 4 5 Taste: 4 5 Looked awesome and tasty! Best to share with more than two people — we couldn’t finish it all and appreciated that the restaurant was happy to provide takeaway boxes. It’s a bit pricey, but when shared among a group, the cost is manageable. Plenty of sauce, both cheese and mayo — loved it!  TIP: Visit during their lunch hours for the set meal — it’s definitely worth the price then!",Val
Found a delicious pasta near your home. The kids like it very much and it tastes great,Irr
Food quite pricey & not very good. At the end had to have post dinner at tiong bahru bakery to fill my stomach.,Val
"Food is nice, service is fast but aircon needs a bit of work. Overall, will come again!",Val
"A Hidden Gem for Fusion Pasta Lovers! 49 Seats never disappoints! I came for the famous Tom Yum Seafood Pasta and it absolutely lived up to the hype — rich, creamy, spicy, and packed with fresh seafood. The Smoked Duck Pasta was another highlight — tender, flavorful, and surprisingly well-balanced.  Service was friendly and attentive, and I liked the chill industrial-style decor — cozy enough for a casual date or gathering with friends. Prices are reasonable given the portion sizes and central location.  Would highly recommend if you’re looking for something different from your usual Western or Asian fare. Will definitely be back to try the salted egg pasta next!",Val

"Rethish, Arvin, Tin & Ning Ning has been really fabulous and super awesome in service. They completed the meal experience and I totally appreciate the attention and the constant pampering. Kudos to Colony and the standard that you uphold both in terms of service. Cocktails can be expanded in terms of variety and options. thumbs_up",Val
"What's to say, but the utopian buffet experience can only be had at the Ritz Carlton Sunday champagne brunch.  From fresh seafood to curated cocktails, you'll be sure to get a bang for your buck if you visit on Sunday for their brunch. Most buffets claim spreads, but the Colony Sunday brunch promises quality of the spread.  Only here can you get bespoke service, where they encourage and entice you to try their 3 cocktails, 2 champagnes, red and white wines, and at least 4 fruit drinks, including the different waters from sparkling to distilled. And if you're lucky to get NingNing, you've won the lottery for the day.  She's the Sunshine of the Colony, and brings you warmth and a personal touch that makes you feel like you've got your personalised butler service. Don't worry about changing plates, or getting wet ones, or cutlery to dig out the delicious crab. She'll get them for you, and with a smile.  Thank you, Ning Ning, for a memorable brunch. We come back because of excellent service from people like you.  A shout out to Tin, Rethish, and Angie as well. You're the stars of Colony.",Val

"Airy, upscale hotel eatery with 7 open kitchens, plus a la carte meals & a generous global buffet. The Colony buffet at the Ritz-Carlton is generally considered a top-tier buffet experience in Singapore, known for its diverse and high-quality food, elegant ambiance, and attentive service. We were invited for dinner by a friend of ours. Loved the ambience  service and food. Two guys at the Pasta section ,took good care of my dietary requirements when I told them make Ravioli for me. They were careful about not adding onions and garlic etc I liked it. The guys at the Pizza section didn't want to make any pizza when I requested for a vegetarian one,not sure what's the point of having a live station catering to diner's needs. They just pointed at a few slices on display which didn't look appetising, so I moved to Pasta section. Desserts and fruits were fresh. At the other sections, food was being replenished in time. Indian food section was untouched,looked full except diner going for mutton and tandoori chicken. Couldn't take photo of the food,will capture it next time. As a vegetarian who doesn't take onion and garlic,there were some options for me like salads, breads, pasta etc. Couldn't find any vegetarian soup as both the soups which were available had meat in it. Loved the architecture. It is wheelchair accessible. Buffet Dinner at Colony (Sundays to Thursdays) Available from Sunday to Thursday from 6 p.m. to 10.30 p.m.The dress code is Smart Casual. Slippers and activewear are not permitted. Covered shoes are required for gentlemen. Thank you for the top tier dining experience.",Val

"Just had the most horrible experience at Colony - Ritz Carlton. I had called the hotel asking for availability for breakfast to take my family there for a celebration. On arrival, the staff rudely just refused a table. The restaurant had many tables available. She just told us that it will get busy later.  No apologies. No one came to help or explain.",Val

"It's delicious no matter what you eat, but it's priced",Irr
"Really dislike how the space is extremely crowded, with tables placed very close to each other. Definitely the worst environment among all the fancy buffets in Singapore. The food is fine, and the desserts are especially good, but I would not return because of the overall setting.",Val
"Tasty food especially the Singapore Heritage Corner featuring duck, chicken, roast pork and char siu (must try!), loved the rojak too for the thick rojak paste used, enjoyed butter chicken, Salmon, Carbonara pasta, Iberico Pork was tender and flavourful, great drink options especially the fruit juices and enjoyed the desserts like Oreo vanilla ice cream and caramel ice cream and gula Melaka cake bar. Special mention must go to the ever-present service staff who were always around clearing plates promptly and refilling of water, excellent service indeed! The Colony delivers an excellent dining experience!!",Val
"The space especially the sushi section , the walkway so narrow and the snow crab and seafood section also kinda narrow. I have eaten many buffet oversea n locally. This the only one I found they dun even wash or clean the oyster shell.  Most of the oysters I took the shell all have sands like never wash beside they peel open. Not a good experience on a 5stars hotel can improve on it and most oysters in hotel I eaten they have prepare and it's nicely off the meat from the shell.   And during the buffet I have diarrhea need to rush for wash room . 1st time I having diarrhea dying a buffet section same with my friend who I treated him for his birthday dinner.  The jackfruit on fruits section is a plus point. Mention: the fried hokkien mee is surprisingly delicious with wok hei.",Val
