"what we had: lunch set (11.30am to 5pm) - starter, main dish and drinks - $17.90 1. tom yum seafood pasta visual: 4.5 5 taste: 4.5 5 creamy, spicy, and tangy — the taste and quality have been consistent for years. this is my go-to dish every time i’m here. i’ve tried tom yum pasta from other places, but this one’s my favorite. the amount of seafood is impressive too — i’m not even a big seafood fan, but i always manage to clean my plate. chef’s kiss. nothing bad to say about it :) 2. cheesy chicken chop visual: 4.5 5 taste: 3.5 5 generous portions — the plate was bigger than we expected! lots of crispy fries and coleslaw to go around. unfortunately, the chicken sauce tasted more like pizza sauce, giving it a pizza-on-chicken vibe. it lacked depth and the “wow” factor was mostly from the portion size. we probably wouldn’t order this dish again. 3. cheese fries (ala carte $9.90) visual: 4 5 taste: 4 5 looked awesome and tasty! best to share with more than two people — we couldn’t finish it all and appreciated that the restaurant was happy to provide takeaway boxes. it’s a bit pricey, but when shared among a group, the cost is manageable. plenty of sauce, both cheese and mayo — loved it! tip: visit during their lunch hours for the set meal — it’s definitely worth the price then!","{""rating"":4,""store_name"":""49 SEATS"",""reviewer_name"":""Jehu Limang""}",Val,4,240,long,high

"the seafood here is super fresh and the portions are really big—great value if you’re coming with a group of at least 4 people. prices might seem high at first, but once you see the portion size, it makes sense. definitely recommend for seafood lovers who enjoy sharing dishes!","{""rating"":5,""store_name"":""Restoran Todak (Orang Asli)"",""reviewer_name"":""Angel Tam""}",Val,5,49,short,high
