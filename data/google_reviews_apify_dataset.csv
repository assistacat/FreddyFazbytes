- crab meat with slime
- shell is big, once open up meat is smaller than anchovies
- crab probably dying soon or already dead
Told front desk about it, they dont even bother to explain,  only ask me how I want to make payment!

A spacious and clean seafood restaurant that serves no pork and no lard, making it suitable for a wider group of diners.

The restaurant is located slightly inside the area, but it's worth the trip. They have a wide variety of live and fresh seafood to choose. All the seafood are market price. Freshly catch and will be weigh in front of you.

The food was great as always, which is why I visit regularly. I especially enjoyed the Teochew steam fish and soy sauce prawn. Prices are average and reasonable for fresh seafood.

Staff were friendly and attentive and service was good.

When we got there it was low tide and it didn't look appealing at all with all the trash in the water.

Service was non existent, find your own seating was the theme. Most of the staff were there to just carry or clear food and not much else.

Do not buy the satay or otah from one of the sub tenants. Total garbage, otah was more flour and colouring and had barely any fish, satay meat was cheap frozen chicken or meat with a lot of greasy fat.  I saw a lot of uneaten otah and satay sticks on many of the tables.

Price wise for 1.5 kg black pepper crab, mapo tofu, Kang Kong and some Chinese lettuce came to RM360. Which was expected for the quality.

However, if you included the time to drive there, it's a barely pass if u're looking for cheap food, if you're expecting decent quality or service, give this place a wide berth especially if getting a grab out of there will take hours of waiting as it's far from the city."

u have to find yr own seats first.. then queue to order yr seafood.

The place is full of mosquitoes so be prepared to be stung whilst dining.

The road into the restaurant is quite bad.. quite sandy and not paved properly.

At peak hours there is no parking available outside..

They don't use digital weighing scale to weight ur seafood and they weigh with the pail. so not very accurate.

If u want to dine there, order the crabs and live sea fish.. the prawns are not live and some are mushy.

the soya sauce for steaming the fish is too sweet..

Lunch Set (11.30am to 5pm) - Starter, main dish and drinks - $17.90

1. Tom Yum Seafood Pasta
Visual: 4.5/5
Taste: 4.5/5
Creamy, spicy, and tangy — the taste and quality have been consistent for years. This is my go-to dish every time I’m here. I’ve tried tom yum pasta from other places, but this one’s my favorite. The amount of seafood is impressive too — I’m not even a big seafood fan, but I always manage to clean my plate. Chef’s kiss.
Nothing bad to say about it :)

2. Cheesy Chicken Chop
Visual: 4.5/5
Taste: 3.5/5
Generous portions — the plate was bigger than we expected! Lots of crispy fries and coleslaw to go around.
Unfortunately, the chicken sauce tasted more like pizza sauce, giving it a pizza-on-chicken vibe. It lacked depth and the “wow” factor was mostly from the portion size. We probably wouldn’t order this dish again.

3. Cheese fries (ala carte $9.90)
Visual: 4/5
Taste: 4/5
Looked awesome and tasty!
Best to share with more than two people — we couldn’t finish it all and appreciated that the restaurant was happy to provide takeaway boxes.
It’s a bit pricey, but when shared among a group, the cost is manageable. Plenty of sauce, both cheese and mayo — loved it!

TIP: Visit during their lunch hours for the set meal — it’s definitely worth the price then!"

49 Seats never disappoints! I came for the famous Tom Yum Seafood Pasta and it absolutely lived up to the hype — rich, creamy, spicy, and packed with fresh seafood. The Smoked Duck Pasta was another highlight — tender, flavorful, and surprisingly well-balanced.

Service was friendly and attentive, and I liked the chill industrial-style decor — cozy enough for a casual date or gathering with friends. Prices are reasonable given the portion sizes and central location.

Would highly recommend if you’re looking for something different from your usual Western or Asian fare. Will definitely be back to try the salted egg pasta next!"

From fresh seafood to curated cocktails, you'll be sure to get a bang for your buck if you visit on Sunday for their brunch. Most buffets claim spreads, but the Colony Sunday brunch promises quality of the spread.

Only here can you get bespoke service, where they encourage and entice you to try their 3 cocktails, 2 champagnes, red and white wines, and at least 4 fruit drinks, including the different waters from sparkling to distilled.
And if you're lucky to get NingNing, you've won the lottery for the day.

She's the Sunshine of the Colony, and brings you warmth and a personal touch that makes you feel like you've got your personalised butler service. Don't worry about changing plates, or getting wet ones, or cutlery to dig out the delicious crab. She'll get them for you, and with a smile.

Thank you, Ning Ning, for a memorable brunch. We come back because of excellent service from people like you.  A shout out to Tin, Rethish, and Angie as well. You're the stars of Colony."

The Colony buffet at the Ritz-Carlton is generally considered a top-tier buffet experience in Singapore, known for its diverse and high-quality food, elegant ambiance, and attentive service.
We were invited for dinner by a friend of ours.
Loved the ambience  service and food.
Two guys at the Pasta section ,took good care of my dietary requirements when I told them make Ravioli for me. They were careful about not adding onions and garlic etc I liked it.
The guys at the Pizza section didn't want to make any pizza when I requested for a vegetarian one,not sure what's the point of having a live station catering to diner's needs. They just pointed at a few slices on display which didn't look appetising, so I moved to Pasta section.
Desserts and fruits were fresh.
At the other sections, food was being replenished in time.
Indian food section was untouched,looked full except diner going for mutton and tandoori chicken.
Couldn't take photo of the food,will capture it next time.
As a vegetarian who doesn't take onion and garlic,there were some options for me like salads, breads, pasta etc. Couldn't find any vegetarian soup as both the soups which were available had meat in it.
Loved the architecture. It is wheelchair accessible.
Buffet Dinner at Colony (Sundays to Thursdays)
Available from Sunday to Thursday from 6 p.m. to 10.30 p.m.The dress code is Smart Casual. Slippers and activewear are not permitted. Covered shoes are required for gentlemen.
Thank you for the top tier dining experience."

We purposely came on Friday night where they served seafood buffet. Understand Sun-Thurs may have some 15% discount for certain credit cards, but no discount on Fri and Sat.

Basically, there are 3 main section of food, the desserts, the cold dishes and the cooked food (together with fruit juices and fruits).

I must say the selection of food is great, but considering the price per pax vs quality , I give it a 4-star only. Some of the food item is quite disappointing, such as the lobsters, al of us concluded the sauce taste funny, and we had to specially asked for it without sauce. The oysters and crabs are fresh though.

The environment is nice and cosy, but t think they placed too many tables, resulting the walkway between tables are narrow and can be dangerous when you move with hands full of food. I give it a 4-star.

The staff are friendly and helpful but they lack of some product knowledge, and we had some
Hard time checking on discounts, and almost needed to avoid our payment. 3 of us paid for $425

Plentiful of parking at the hotel car park and they do give complimentary parking ticket."

Though the buffet ended at 2.30p.m., the staff allow us to sit till 6p.m. before their dinner commencement. Really appreciate their kind gesture and thoughtfulness.

The international buffet has a good range of dishes to choose from. The cold prawns and crab are really fresh likewise for the sashimi.
If you like ""hum full"" laksa, this is the place for it. Lemak gravy which has the old school taste.
Thanks for the good experience today. Reservation recommended."

정말 럭키하게도 예약 당일 때마침 리츠칼튼 근처에서 GS60주년 폭죽행사를 보고 신나게 생일기념 여행 마지막날 저녁식사를 하러 갔네요 :)

들어가자마자 성함이 lee lee 라는 서버님이 너무 친절하게 안내해 주시고, 첫 싱가포르 여행이랬더니 정말이지 엄청난 싱가포르 식문화를 제대로 알게 해주셨습니다. 그래서 진짜 이름을 계속해서 기억을 못할 수 가 없었어요.
식문화를 제대로 소개해 주시겠다며 여러 쉐프님과 그 쉐프님들의 음식을 조금씩 가져다 주시며 작은 설명까지 해주셨어요.
다국적 나라이 듯 음식도 엄청나게 다채롭고 맛있고 아름답네요!

일단 마지막날까지 먹어보지 못한 크랩이 궁금했는데 yong wei 쉐프님이 크랩요리 소개해주면서 엄청난 맛의 크랩을 맛보여 주셨어요.
그리고 더불어 랍스터까지 있는 콜로니이기에 sanghyuk 쉐프님이 모짜렐라를 듬뿍 올린 랍스터 구이를 가져다 주셨어요. 보니 반가운 한국인 이시더라구요!
그래서 설명도 조금 더 자세하게 해주셨습니다 :)
그리고 그 외에서 엄청 싱싱한 굴과 새우 홍합을 주셨던 hui jun쉐프님, 구운오리를 맛보여 주신 richard쉐프님, 첫날 진짜 맛있게 먹었던 꼬치요리 사테를 리얼 싱가포르 사테 맛으로 알려주신 danish쉐프님, 하나 같이 너무 다 맛있고 다채롭고 진짜 오지 않았더라면 크게 후회했을 나를 칭찬했습니다.
이 모든 상황과 몰랐던 음식을 알게되고 싱가포르를 더 잘 알게 되어서 정말 너무 행복한 시간이었습니다.

참, 샐러드 코너 쪽 가면 hui jun쉐프님이 rojack이라는 싱가포르 샐러드 같은 음식을 하고 계시는데 저는 그게 진짜 맛있고 인상 깊었거든요. 땅콩 여러 향신료 야채와 과일을 비벼주시는데 꼭 먹어보셨으면 해요. 그것 까지 먹으면 싱가포르 정복입니다!

음식의 퀄리티도 서비스도 너무 최상급이라 콜로니가 역시 호텔뷔페구나 했고, 호텔 뷔페인데도 불구하고 이렇게나 많은 사람들이 이용하는 것이, 예약이 그렇게 가득 차있던 이유를 알 수 있었어요.

싱가포르 여행 왔을 때 까지도 사실 크게 기대도 여운도 없었는데, 식문화를 알려주시는 친절하시고 다정한 싱가포르 코로니 직원분들을 만나 다시 꼭 싱가포르를 오고 싶어졌습니다.
싱가포르를 온다면 무조건 여기는 꼭 들르고 갈 것 같아요. 감사합니다!"

After making a reservation, I was contacted by one of the staff and advised that I could arrive earlier if I wished to so that I would have more time for my dinner. Of course, I gladly obliged and changed my reservation to an earlier time.
Upon arriving at Colony, the wife and I were seated promptly by their manager and a server immediately came to our table and explained the place to us. Service was impeccable; plates were cleared fast, serviettes were replenished before we finished those given and lemon water and scissors were brought to us minutes after my server noticed that we had taken crabs/prawns. As we were slightly into our dessert, a birthday cake was brought to our table unprompted; a level of attentiveness that surprised us.
The food was great but the oysters that night were sandy and unfortunately gave my wife a stomachache the entire night.
Atmosphere was as what one would expect from a higher-end buffet although I found the seats were too close to each other."

my favourite is the japanese cruisine bar, sashimi thickly sliced, sushi rice was nicely seasoned and fluffy, not hard like rice cakes.

the oysters were fresh and plump, decent size!
prawns fresh too so easy to peel, none of them were mushy.

dessert bar so amazing, literally wished i left tummy space for this. we all know lots of hotel buffets dont care about dessert selection as long they look good but taste like cupboard cakes from some random factory, but Colony has dessert that you know are definitely crafted with care!"

From the moment I stepped in, the ambiance was warm and inviting, and the service exceeded expectations.

The food selection was impressive and of exceptional quality, catering to a wide range of tastes. Each dish was well-prepared, flavorful, and beautifully presented.

What truly made the experience memorable was the impeccable service provided by the staff. In particular, I would like to commend Ryan, who was exceptionally friendly, attentive, and helpful throughout. His professionalism and genuine hospitality significantly enhanced our overall dining experience.

I highly recommend The Colony to anyone looking for a top-tier dining experience with both excellent food and service."

It brought back lots of memories when I brought her to this hotel recently ❤️

They maintain their standard super well & in fact, much better, especially the service!

All food are fresh & delicious!  The only downside is there are too much varieties but we got limited space for every single dish 😭

Love the dessert!!  So yummy and yet not too sweet:-) Very suitable for someone like me, aging & watching my diet closely & carefully 😂

Special thanks to Raj Rethish (hope I got his name correctly)!  He noticed we didn’t eat a lot like others so came by to encourage us to eat more 😀 & when he heard me sharing about my girl’s 1st/last visit was 17 years ago, he came back with a box of macron for us to bring home 🥰🥰

It used to have a members 4 Course Lunch /month at a discounted price .
However since Covid, not only the quality but also the format for the member's lunch changed. Now it is a 3 Course Lunch offered at a higher price. I visited the place a few days ago & was very disappointed by not only the quality but also the quantity of the offerings. The Main Dish was very reduced in quantity & the Dessert was 1/2 of what it used to be.  The saving grace -is that the Service is still very good. They added a New Dish -Plant based Meatless burger which is terrible as the Patty was ""Dry"" & made out of Mushroom & Soya! (not like the beyond meat burger).
Overall a disappointing Bistro now.

Lighthouse Bistro has been a nice Restaurant in the past. But since Jan2023, standards have dropped & it has now become an average restaurant. The prices have been raised steeply, the ""Members"" monthly menu reduced from 4 course to 3 course, quantities / dish portions reduced & overall quality average. Further the place has only two stereotyped veg dishes- Pasta & Fried Rice for a number of years & it seems the Management is ""oblivious"" of the changing tastes worldwide, where these days ALL Restaurants in West have atleast 25%-30% Veg dishes in the Menu! Further All Restaurants in West have NO HALLAL but only Veg, Nonveg dishes..unlike in Singapore...where Vegetarians are forced to accept what is available..however mediocre the dishes & quality are. Restaurants like Lighthouse Bistro should have more variety & courses for Vegetarians , compared to Non Vegetarians as vegetables cheaper than meats & more healthy."

The seafood platter enough for 4 people to share was awesome, prawns, muscles, squid & battered fish stick was a beautiful way to start the meal.

The came the ribeye steak, juicy, succulent, tender & flavourful and accompanied with fries....oh lala!!

If that was not enough, my wife and I had Anglehair mee goreng which, was piping hot and a must have. Never thought that this would taste so nice but trust me it did. Infact, every dish we had was lovely. Been sometime since we ate at a place that all the dishes we ordered was soooo nice.

To top it off, the service staff was first class, professional,  attentive, warm and a shout out the Ken. Ken's the man, he provided an amazing service throughout dinner. Thank you Ken.

You can be sure I'll recommend this wonderful place in all aspects to anyone asking for a great restaurant. Oh yes and the price is not gonna make you fall off your chair. It is reasonable, fair and worth the money. An amazing restaurant, soft music, a place fit gir dignitaries....provided they don't mind it not being in the heart of Orchard...hehe!!"

Our server, Ken, provided top-notch service, attentive and friendly. The food was nothing short of spectacular. The sous vide ribeye was cooked to perfection, tender and bursting with flavor, while the scallop pasta was executed flawlessly, with every bite a savory delight. The sea perch stood out too, beautifully presented and seasoned just right. And the truffle fries? They arrived in a generous, towering mountain, fried to crispy perfection and infused with that irresistible truffle aroma. The drinks were expertly crafted and paired wonderfully with the meal.

I liked most of the food, except maybe the mushroom soup as it tasted a bit bland for me. But the lava cake was the one that left me the greatest impression- it is probably the best lava cake I’ve ever eaten! The presentation looks great, and the fruits were all really fresh and sweet. The cake also had good moisture, unlike most lava cakes out there.

Staff are also really attentive and were also very elaborate when I asked them for recommendations for a drink.

Understand that they had switched their oyster supplier to the US.  Previously the oyster was just average.  Good management decision to switch to a better supplier that provides big n deep based oyster.  I had eaten slightly over a dozen for my weekday dinner buffet.

The snow crab claws / pincers was tasty with seafood sweetness.  I don't usually eat snow crab as it can be really messy n may chip off your teeth.  But I certainly enjoyed the snow crab claws!

The plain water were served without any slices of lemon.   Incredible service for this highly rated hotel.  Anyways the staff had quickly served on a small plate a few slices when I made the request.  The service staff were attentive to take away side plates when these were full including the wrapping of the Japanese chopsticks.  Very professional guys.  Kudos to all of you for making my dining experience at Colony god in this aspect.  Some were chatty as they engaged us in small talks.

As for the other foods, the choices are pretty limited n tasted just average.  Should revamp the types of dishes to give these an atas taste as well as look n feel.

There was no udon or ramen or cold noodle at all!  Just unbelievable!!!  The sushi were so hard n not placed in a mini fridge after these were made.  How to preserve the freshness of Japanese sushi!!!  These are coming from me who is a lay person in F&B.

The honey comb was pathetic n barely sweet and tugged away in an inconspicuous corner that I missed out until my wife told me!!!

Promised to replace my small bottle of honey to go with my camomile tea but one of the caps was so tight even the waiting staff n my strong n young son cannot even open it).  The bottle of honey unfortunately was forgotten by the waiting staff n we had to share those bottles that were opened.

The Chinese food especially the roasted duck n char siew are so average n the soup (black bean) was so disappointing.

Dim sum was very disappointing n the attitude of the chef making the Chinese noodle for a hotel like Riltz Carlton was wanting n lack professionalism!!!

Pastas n Indian food offerings were slightly above average.

Overall, I don't get good vibes for my the dining experience here n maybe because I had previously made several visits before.  Hardly any glamour n let alone looking forward to yet another visit.

Buffet at Pan Pacific (although rated as one star lower) had alot of offerings.  Really good value for the food.  Maybe I had a better experience there.

May have to look for a good alternative given my last experience at Colony that was not great at all except for the oyster n salmon sashimi"

I have emailed your establishment in Jan 2025 to formally express my concern following a dining experience with multiple parasites found in oysters. Unfortunately, I have not yet received a response.

During our meal, I selected three oysters from the rack and immediately noticed a large parasite swimming inside one of them (approximately the size of half a strand of spaghetti). I was shocked and shoved the plate to your staff, who acknowledged the issue.

Subsequently, I was assured that three new oysters would be provided. I inquired whether these had been thoroughly checked to ensure they were free from any parasites, and your team confirmed they had been inspected.

However, upon consuming one of the replacement oysters, I observed a parasite swimming inside again. This recurrence is deeply concerning and raises serious questions about the sourcing and handling of your seafood"

The buffet offers a variety of different food of different taste and style. For example, there is Indian, Chinese, Japanese and American food. My personal favourite is the sashimi from the Japanese section and bread from the bread section. There was also free flow  juices to drink from. However, as I am a kid and I love sweets and gummies, I was a bit let down by the desserts in the desserts section. There was too little toppings for the ice cream toppings and there was no sweets. There was also no chocolate fountain and marshmallows. (No hate)
The service was great, the staff is warm and friendly. They always clear the plates and pour water in our cups when there is no more water left.
Overall, I think this was a good buffet and I hope it can improve on the dessert section."

When I asked service for lobsters, they say that it depends on availability and they replaced it with vegetable pizza???
I mean are you fr!?!?
We went for seafood of course, why on earth would we spend$114/person and take an hour’s transportation for VEGETABLE PIZZA? We could have had that at Dominos or Pizza Hut!!!
We chose Colony between many other buffets like RISE and EDGE, I checked their menu, called staff to make sure there was lobsters but no at all when we arrived!
We were so disappointed since we literally came especially for the lobsters.
I just don’t know what to say, if you’re going to make a fake menu and trick people to nothing, that’s def a fraud.

Parking was easy since ATP is quiet on non-working days, and the outlet is tucked between Blocks A & B. Most eateries were closed, so this was a nice find.

The café has a cosy, minimalist vibe. We ordered the Ebi and Fried Chicken sandos. The bread—soft and buttery like brioche—was definitely the highlight. Sauces were flavourful and well-balanced. Unfortunately, the patties themselves (ebi and fried chicken) were quite bland on their own, relying heavily on the sauces to shine.

the food here, though, is hit and miss. my family and i thoroughly enjoyed their signature chicken dish and 青龍菜. the other dishes like black pepper crayfish, golden tofu and iberico char siew, were just ok. i did a quick scan around (because kpo) to see what dishes other diners ordered, and i saw that a lot of people ordered their fried rice. i’ll try it on my next visit!"

Food wise, portions are generally smaller though prices are lower(so you will need to order larger portions). Taste wise, I must say do not order scallops (frozen, tough and tasteless) they are not fresh, coffee ribs is quite sweet, prawn heavy msg taste...very average food quality.

They are very quick to wanna get you to leave. Booking for 1.5hrs, family dinner, 1hr they will start to clear your table with two servers.

Chillax location on a Saturday morning without noisy patrons. Easy parking within ATP itself. Add on a walk at Hort Park (side gate has direct access to ATP).

Warm and friendly service. Reasonable prices compared to other sando places which charge high $20s. Here the sandwiches are net prices and mostly under $17.

We had:
1. Beef brisket - flavorful, enjoyed it lots
2. Hoki fish - fish was over fried to a hard crisp. It was just ok
3. Spam-O - thick slab of spam and hash brown. Can’t go wrong with this combo
4. Flat white, Cappuccino - good cuppas

Breakfast sandos +$3 for a sizeable portion of tater tots.

Will absolutely return again for a chill, tasty and value meal."

The parking signage is pretty bad for someone who is unfamiliar with the area and entered the sheltered carpark instead. Really difficult to get lots in the sheltered carpark, so turn up towards the slope which leads to an open-air carpark. See my parking tips.

While the tonkatsu sando and crispy chicken wingettes were well-flavoured, I was super thirsty within an hour after the meal. The bun was also rather underwhelming, and seemed to taste like normal bakery buns. Perhaps their donburi would be better, which wouldn't match the name of the café!

For coffee, the Spanish latte tasted average. The mild aroma of the coffee beans is good for those who do not want to return to the office with strong coffee breath!"

For some strange reason, we would willingly squeeze in with the crowds, just like many other families. Reservations are highly recommended, almost mandatory.

It used to be far more chaotic, but they have now streamlined their processes with three dinner seatings: 5:00pm, 6:30pm, and 8:00pm. If you are in the first slot, parking is usually available. For later slots, be prepared for the traffic jam outside the restaurant before being able to hand your car over to the valet.

Once inside, everything runs like clockwork, as long as you manage to catch the attention of the waitstaff. If not, you risk wasting precious minutes from your 1.5 hour dining time, as dishes do take time to arrive.

The atmosphere is incredibly lively, ranging from crying babies, the occasional semi-tipsy uncle, and the chatter of families over food.

As for the menu, our staple includes the coffee ribs, black pepper beef cubes, prawn rolls, vegetables with shark cartilage broth, and of course, the crabs. We usually go for the chilli crab, which tastes more tomato than chilli, but is already spicier than elsewhere. The black pepper crab is a strong contender, though it can be a bit too pepperish at times.

All in all, a good place for family dinners, but if you would prefer to avoid the crowd, consider going on a weekday before 6:30pm."

Only issue is, every staff is so busy and no one to provide directions or help to take orders or clear tables. Eg. When we first arrive at the carpark, it was unclear that we needed to go through right to the back and 'catch' a willing staff to Show us to our table (with reservations). They forgot about my baby chair which i did indicate during reservation so imagine the fluster with one adult getting the highchair and trying to clean the chair and other to ensure baby doesnt struggle too much.

We had to wave very hard to grab a staff attention to take our orders. Food is served relatively fast though.

When i want to make payment, i couldnt find a staff so i walked up in front and was asked to sit back at my table for someone to assist."

Mee goreng using angel hair was a very bad choice.  Too sweet and pasta very soggy,  had to throw away as too sweet to eat. Sotong was like rubber.

Can’t recommend though waiter was superb and polite though he kept missing our table’s requests.  Prices are high for bistro, and food worse than hawker quality."

Though I am not a tomato cream lover but I must said that the way they cooked the pasta is totally perfect. The scallops are fresh and seared to perfection. My boy totally love the Mango Day Spring as it is absolutely refreshing.

I totally love my latte with the taste of Bailey. Totally aromatic and the blend of latte with Bailey is so well balanced.

Tucked at a quiet corner, this Bristro is away from the crowd and it is a hidden gem. Do drop by to try out on your own."

I tried the brisket, fish and beef patty burgers. Burger buns were average. Fish is real fish meat with some ""fishiness"". Beef patty was weird that was deep fried with some batter . Brisket was the worst . It was like steamed slices of meat with fats that made it really hard to chew. All the burgers had its own distinctive sauce that didn't really go well together as a burger.

I got the fish burger - it’s like an elevated version of McDonald’s filet o fish, with chunkier (and fresh) fish patties. Great burger bun, also liked the slaw though it would be nice to have a little more to cut through the greasiness.

Tater tots tasted how you’d expect tater tots to taste. The mushroom fritters were fried well, but too greasy and the batter was too thick.

We also tried a few drinks - matcha latte, hojicha latte and royal milk tea. Matcha latte was pretty good. The hojicha latte is on the sweeter side. Royal milk tea is the most unique drink of the three, with a nice tea fragrance.

Gave a 3 star rating because while the food was decently good, it’s not something I see myself going back for again unless I’m in the area."

We spent over $600, and not a single dish was good.  The black pepper crayfish had no black pepper taste and was mainly sweet sauce.   All the dishes looked good and were cooked well but the taste was off...again too heavy handed on sugar and black sauce.
The service was horrendous.   The wait staff used to be so friendly, but they were all just too rushed and came across as rude.  Request for water, etc, was acknowledged but never delivered.
Perhaps but to stick to the seafood restaurants in East Coast or Dempsey."

Overpriced, small portions and all of the dishes we ordered tasted so bad. Tomato scallop pasta was worse than canned pasta sauce, har jeong kai chicken did not have the taste of prawn paste at all, the duck breast was cut so thickly that it was hard to eat and the matcha latte tasted so bland. We were so famished so we just ate, paid and left feeling awful that we wasted money (almost $150!!!) and calories on this meal.

It was relatively quiet on a Saturday night and we appreciate that. Waiter was very polite with good service. We ordered the lamb shank, ribeye steak along with 2 mocktails. Mocktails and food came within 15min after we placed order!

Lamb shank was tender, with slight gamey taste but still very acceptable! I quite enjoyed this dish and especially like how each component (sauce, mashed potatoes & veg) is well integrated together without getting too heavy.

Ribeye steaks were tasty with medium rare doneness but a pity that the black pepper were overly charred resulting in bitterness on the steak. Hence, I didn't enjoy this dish as much.

Overall, food and service are pretty good and would come back to try the other dishes in future."

🌟 Sea Perch ($28)
Topped with black caviar, the crispy flavourful sea perch comes with buttery mashed potato and asparagus 🐟 Would recommend!

🌟 Lamb Shank ($28)
Braised for hours to achieve a fall-off-the-bone tender goodness, the lamb shank came in a good portion. I am not a huge fan of lamb and found this a little too gamey for my liking 🍖

Overall, prices are reasonable and you can enjoy additional savings with Burpple. For Burpple members, enjoy 1-for-1 mains + drinks when you visit! 📣

At the discounted rates, this is honestly quite a steal 🥹

But dem the food and service is really good!

Got the platter, the fish is battered nice, prawns fried nicely, the mussels taste so good with the sauce but whatever the sauce is (think it's garlic something) mixed with the squid is so dem good, ya can dip the fries or anything in it and it will be good!

The calamari with buttermilk cream is very good too, it just meshes very well with the buttermilk sauce.

Next up is the classic lamb shank, ok this is an all star. Firstly the meat is superbly tender, secondly there is no gamey taste of lamb and thirdly the sauce brings everything including the potato mash and veggies together so well.

Lastly is the lava cake and ice cream for desert, both paired very well with each other, the creaminess of the ice cream and the savoriness of the choc lava cake.

Would I come again to try their other dishes, sure definitely 😁

Looking at you Mr sou vide ribeye steak. Haha 😂"

First time there intro-ed through a friend who works at Capella.
Food - 10/10, would highly highly recommend their truffle pizza and meatballs. The food were served hot.
Service - 10/10, comparable to fine dining quality service, light laughters and jokes, not too over the top with gestures and expressions. Feels personal.
Atmosphere - 10/10, spacious , well distanced tables, tho I would say I’m abit tall for the sofa , had to slouche abit. I’m 1.8m.

Overall , considering the food quality and service, definitely will come back. The price is on higher side and it’s worth the experience.

There is also a set menu of $188++ for 9 course curated by the chef, have not tried but sounds amazing."

Our waiter DaVinci was ever so lovely, thoughtful and polite. Our experience with service at Singapore cafes and restaurants before Fiamma wasn’t great - but this place goes above and beyond to ensure you feel special.

The complimentary bread and oil was a lovely touch. We ordered the burrata della costiera to start and the burrata was so fresh, as was the dressing, it went perfectly with the bread. I then ordered the ziti alla genovese pasta - the ragout just melted in my mouth. My husband had Diavola pizza which had so much flavour.

Our server was attentive, noticing dietary preferences we didn’t communicate, and was knowledgeable about the menu. The staff also gave two desserts for my mother’s birthday, as they noted some of the guests didn’t like cheese.

However, the food is where Fiamma fell flat. We had started off strong, with meatballs and búfala cheese as the appetisers, and they were fantastic. The mains left much to be desired, with the pasta being overcooked to the point of mushiness, and the seafood unfortunately was not the freshest.

Thank you to Fiamma staff, who made the experience enjoyable nevertheless. It goes to show that service can save what would’ve been a gastronomical nightmare."

High quality, delicious and plentiful. A real treat.

The service however was hit and miss with dishes lying uncleared, water not replenished and a surly sommelier. Whilst appreciating this is a brunch, and maybe not the teams favourite service, as a five star hotel I expected that to be better.

That said the food would still tempt me back when I’m in the mood for Italian."

The tomahawk steak was cooked perfectly to a tender, juicy medium rare that melted in the mouth. The blue lobster was fresh, and the pasta was cooked to perfection — though for my personal taste, the sauce was a touch too creamy. The tiramisu was outstanding, with freshly made cream that was light yet indulgent.

Service was excellent — the wait team was warm, professional, and incredibly accommodating, making the experience feel polished and welcoming.

The only downside was the small flies that joined us throughout the meal when seated outdoors, which was a little distracting. I’d recommend choosing an indoor table for a more comfortable experience, and I do hope the restaurant can address this, as everything else was truly exceptional."

There are 3 crab meals you need to try but we can only order 1 so we started things off with the popular Claypot Crab Bee Hoon soup. You can select the weight of the crab depending on availability. Got the Signature Deep Fried Homemade Beancurd and Scallops & Asparagus with XO Sauce for some greens. A cold bottle of beer seems right for the moment. You can get a glass of water for free but adding ice will cost you a little. The beancurd which measure 3x1x1 is huge and chunky with a crispy texture on the outside but soft and chewy on the inside. Its really good and a must try. The soup from the claypot carb is so rich and tasty, its almost a meal on its own. Probably good if paired with a cup of rice to soak up all the juice. Its one of the best crab meal I ever had in Singapore and I still haven't tried the spicy or butter crab meal yet. Payment is made at the counter after you're finish. Cash payment instead of card will get you additional discount. Digital payment not accepted here. Inside the restroom washing  area is a picture wall of diners who FORGOT to pay and just walked away. Such a shame as this is such a great place to have a crab meal. Staff are so helpful and efficient so lets all play fair. As Mellben is located on the lower floor of an apartment residential block away from the Orchard strip... travelling here is a 20 to 30 minute taxi ride. Getting back is harder even if there's a bus route nearby. Best option is to book on a ride-sharing or taxi app. Truth be told.... after having this delicious crab meal everything is now downhill at this point. A queuing booth in front of the store tells you that despite its  a big restaurant will lots of seating area... there's quite a wait during peak so try to come early and avoid the big crowd. If you have read my review up to this point.. Its a must-visit. Bring a couple of friends and order the Clay pot, Butter and Spicy Crab trifecta. A few bottles of cold beer and there you have... a very satisfying if not the best crab meal in town."

Nestled within the lush grounds of Capella Singapore, the ambience is both elegant and inviting — airy, refined, and perfect for a leisurely afternoon. It feels like stepping into a sophisticated Italian home, with thoughtful touches that elevate the overall atmosphere.

The brunch itself is a celebration of Italian flavours and craftsmanship. From fresh seafood and crudo to beautifully roasted meats, handmade pasta, and indulgent desserts, every dish was thoughtfully prepared and full of character. It’s a place where rustic Italian soul meets contemporary finesse.

Equally impressive is the level of hospitality and service. The team is warm, professional, and sincerely attentive. They strike a perfect balance between polished service and heartfelt care.

A special thank you to Mr Da Vinchi, Beatrice, Sarah, Mr Kumar, and Mr Shahie for their outstanding service — their presence truly enhanced the experience.

Furthermore, the lobster meat itself was incredibly mushy like a paste, probably lobster that was not fresh. We expected the lobster meat to be fresh and firm as we’ve never tried lobster meat this mushy and bad. Afterwards we enquired from the man wearing a blazer, he told us that the pasta sauce was broiled with lobster shells and heads, thus the smell. (However the smell was more unpleasant rather than fragrant.) He also said that the lobster meat was “intentionally cooked this way” to be mushy… (Not sure if well cooked lobster meat is supposed to be so soft that turns into a paste as I’m under the impression that fresh lobsters generally  have a  slightly more firm and pleasant texture) The man also did not seem open to receive feedback from us on how we feel about the pasta so we did not want to continue talking to him about it."

Firstly when we enter, we caught the whole staff resting. They were all surprised to see us. Thankfully their response was prompt and professional so a plus! Service was impeccable and efficient. Everything was done right from service to accessories for dining. Price wise was also on the affordable side and menu has a good variety. Portion sizes were good too except for the sauces which were given sparingly. Taste wise was okay but not impressive enough for a star. Their signature lamb shank was disappointing as the texture was rough and powdery. Meat was too dry for my liking. Souve ribeye steak was nicely medium rare and the crust was done right. Except for the cut may be too lean for my liking and also too much tendons within the meat. So no star here. Ambience was good and seatings were spacious. Everything was fine and we enjoyed the dining experience except for the meat took us a long while to chew.  Overall a good 3 star rating and towards the 4 star. Hopefully the signature dishes get some improvement and same for the ribeye."

At Sando, the star ingredient is the shokupan, a Japanese milk bread renowned for its softness and slight sweetness. Made from an enriched dough, this bread is fluffy, moist, and incredibly soft even after toasting. Each slice is thoroughly buttered and toasted to perfection – soft in the middle, lightly crisp on the edges, with a rich buttery flavour. This dreamy bread forms the perfect base for Sando’s delightful creations.

June’s Manager’s Meal – Ebi Baddie Sando

Shrimpy Patty, Hashbrown, Spicy Peach Salsa, Truckloads of Cheese, Lemon Vinaigrette, Lettuce

The Ebi Baddie Sando is a burst of flavours and textures. The succulent shrimp cutlets are crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, with a prominent torched flavour that adds a smoky dimension. The spicy peach salsa introduces a sweet and fruity profile, perfectly balanced by the bright, zesty boost from the lemon vinaigrette. It’s a complex yet harmonious blend of flavours that left a lasting impression.

Tamagoyaki Sando

Tamagoyaki, Japanese Curry Egg Salad, Katsuobushi, Napa Cabbage, House-made Tonkatsu Sauce

This sando is an umami bomb, thanks to the savoury tamagoyaki (Japanese rolled omelette) at its core. Flavored with dashi stock, the tamagoyaki has a slightly sweet taste and custardy texture that pairs wonderfully with the Japanese curry egg salad. The katsuobushi and napa cabbage add depth and crunch, while the house-made tonkatsu sauce ties it all together. The strong dashi flavour might be overwhelming for some, but it’s a must-try for umami lovers.

Har Jeong-Aage Sando

Shrimp Paste Fried Chicken (Har Jeong Kai), Atchara, Cheddar, Overeasy Egg, Honey Mustard

The Har Jeong-Aage Sando is a delightful fusion of flavours. The shrimp paste fried chicken is juicy and flavourful, thanks to a savory marinade. Paired with atchara – fresh and crunchy pickled green papaya – and the creamy overeasy egg, each bite is a delightful mix of textures and tastes. The cheddar adds a rich, creamy layer, while the honey mustard provides a sweet and tangy finish.

Sando’s dedication to quality and craftsmanship is evident in every bite. From the softness of the shokupan to the thoughtful pairing of ingredients, each sando is a testament to the simplicity and joy of good food. Plus, with islandwide delivery and pickup available, along with a reasonable delivery fee of $8 (or free delivery for orders above $120), you can enjoy these delicious creations from the comfort of your home or office."

So I decided to check out this joint. Sadly, the quality of the food could be better. But generally I liked the vibes of the place. The crew was cheerful and the deco was classy.

Tonkatsu sando
Pork could do with more seasoning. Batter wasn’t well done. Didn’t taste Japanese at all. Over fried.

Yakitori chicken sando
A bit better than the tonkatsu. But still lacked seasoning. Didn’t give me the Japanese vibes at all.

Tator tots
Not seasoned enough and over fried. Could be due to old oil being used. I can’t confirm this.

Corn croquette
Not too bad. But the corn kernels felt a bit hard. Again tasted of old oil.

Espresso

This well-established gem has maintained its consistency over the years, serving up hearty, flavorful dishes that never disappoint.

Two signatures we always come back for: the buttery crabs and crab bee hoon. The buttery sauce is luxuriously smooth with a nutty depth that clings beautifully to every bite. And the crab bee hoon? Comfort in a claypot—thick vermicelli steeped in a rich, umami-packed broth that warms the soul, especially on rainy days.

If you’re after a no-fuss, satisfying crab feast, Melben delivers time and again."

Before I even arrived at the restaurant, the waiter who spoke with a northern Chinese accent pressured my friends into ordering an excessive amount of food and kept encouraging them to add more dishes.
As I arrived and requested to adjust the order, another waitress responded with a rude and unfriendly attitude, completely lacking in basic customer service. It ruined the excitement I had for dining at this highly recommended restaurant.
The only redeeming part was the owner, who handled the bill at the end with professionalism and warmth.
Unfortunately, the frontline staff’s poor attitude and the lack of service awareness sharply contrast with the owner’s demeanor, leaving a seriously negative impression of the restaurant as a whole."

That being said. I loved the sando. It was so so good and I loved the criss cut fries, and their craft beer selection was great too, they stock things you dont regularly see. Just loved the food and drinks.

The glass that was cleared was for a different red wine, and there was some wine left in the bottle (it’s for a Nero d’Avola), The existing glass I had was for a Brunello di Montalcino.

I understand that the restaurant needs to close by 10.30pm but there is no need to be hasty about it. When I asked if I could sit outside for a short while and finish up my wines, I was given a negative answer and the glasses and wines have to be cleared.

No one checked on us to see if we could be made more comfortable by having our wines being corked and taken away in a carrier bag until we asked for it.

For a restaurant in an exclusive hotel like Capella, the service is rather appalling. What would have been a good night out was left with a slightly bitter aftertaste.

Jerry Gwee, IWS, SWS, FWS

(P.S. There is only one standard sized wine glass for white wines. Bigger reds like Barolos, Super Tuscans, Brunello di Montalcinos, Chianti Classicos all deserve wine glasses with bigger bowls for the wines to breathe and showcase their aromatics well. Standard sized wine glasses detract from the experience of enjoying these wines, especially when they are priced high.)"

It transcended mere sustenance; it was an experience.  Each bite felt infused with homemade warmth and genuine passion. I especially remember the Polpette—tender meatballs brimming with herbs and spices, served with a rich, flavorful sauce—a taste sensation I'll long remember.

Only feedback is (1) portions for the appetisers and protein for the pastas are small and can be more generous, and (2) outdoors can be humid/warm (they provided a cooler fan but got warm towards the end although that was partly cos of food and alcohol).

Overall we enjoyed ourselves and will be back~

Price-wise, it’s quite affordable by Singapore standards — I spent around $300 for 4 small crabs, along with mantou and tofu, which comfortably fed four people.

Tip: Be sure to call ahead and make a reservation to avoid long waiting times — it gets busy!

I’ll definitely be back for another visit!

we had the polpette meatballs to start – absolutely packed with flavour and just melted in the mouth, this is definitely a must try! the diavola pizza was well balanced, and the linguine was spot on – al dente and sauced beautifully and left us wanting more!

for dessert, the tiramisu was absolutely fantastic (i would come back just for that), and because i was celebrating my birthday, they surprised me with a slice of cheesecake too, which was also so so good!

what made the experience even more special was the service. warm, genuine, and thoughtful. they even gifted my baby daughter a peacock plushie, which honestly says a lot about the kind of hospitality they offer.

fiamma nails the food, the ambience, and the experience. j can’t wait to go back!"

The food is honestly good. However the service and restaurant policy is rubbish. So for this reason we are giving them 1 star review. We were there on 2nd April 2025, for dinner at 730 pm. We were a 2 pax party. We wanted to order 2 different cooking styles of crab. The staff told us that each crab has to be above 1kg for them to cook one dish. The staff told us to select our own crab. We selected a crab that was 900g, almost 1kg. He said  they cannot cook the dish if the crab is less than 1kg. He told us to reselect the crab. He refused to select the crab for us. He insisted we select the crab ourselves. We ended up selecting 2 crabs that weigh 2.8kg. For 2 pax, this is a lot. However we were very hungry so we decided to just go ahead with it. We brought a bottle of wine, and our own wineglasses. The restaurant wanted to charge us corkage of $12. The crabs for 2 pax was $330. We felt that as a goodwill gesture it would have been nice if they waived the corkage for us, given that we brought our own wineglasses. We decided to order their house wine which costs $50. The staff served this wine and did not even bother to bring wine glasses for us! Frankly we were so fed up that we decided to just enjoy the food and make this the last visit here. Even though the crab dishes were good, the service and restaurant policy really left a bad taste in our mouth. We definitely won’t be back here again."

Happened to find as i was looking for thai food in the area.
Limited parking and i was lucky to get 1 within 5 mins. Probably around 10 lots max n i guess. U need to park further or at those industrial buildings nearby.

Old rustic feel which hasn't been renovated for years. Chairs felt abit shakey due to age i guess.

Ok for the food. Misses for the prawns which was hard and not fresh.
Beef was just as bad due to the hardness, dry and sad feel. Will skip these 2 if i order again.

Prawn cakes, pandan chicken and Sotong were very good. Thumbs up for these. Fresh tender and nice.
Omelette was nicely done as well but then again, rarely do you get this dish wrong isnt it.

Service was good and it seems most were thais. Very crowded on this Sunday evening, full house in fact.

Price wise - indeed as per what their signboard rave but also do note of the portion size. Its mostly on the small size."

Used to be cheaper and came here a lot when studying at a school nearby. Prices went up since 2017 but the food is excellent. The Thai Beef green curry is a must get, so is the basil sauce fish fillet. It is closed from 3-6pm so take note. Recently they seem to start taking reservations, so if you have a big group might want to call earlier to get seats. The Thai milk tea and lemon grass drinks are very nice!"

Crowd was decent, with few empty tables. Ordered 4 dishes (tomyum soup, red curry, Kang Kong and basil squid in chili sauce)  Waited about 15 mins before first 2 dishes finally arrived (squid and Kang Kong). Rice almost finishing and the last 2 dishes didn't arrive. Give reminders but seems like no use... Waited about 20 mins still no order was served. Decided to cancel our last 2 dishes.
Half the people in the eatery were already done with eating so I'm not really sure why the 2 dishes needed to take so long to arrive.
Doesn't make sense to wait 20 mins in btw meals for dishes.
If you need customer to wait long period please inform the customer upfront, they can decide if they are keen to wait. Not make people eat halfway and wait."
