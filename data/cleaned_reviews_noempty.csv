Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),5,We went for dinner. Busy as always. But still serve food at right time. They cook vegetarian food also.,Gomathy Rajandran
Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),4,Good food. Service depends on how crowded. No menu.  You need to know what you want to eat.  Evening meals are better as you can sit next to the sea.  Getting there without a car is challenging.,Khaira Cheah
Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),1,超级烂服务，尤其华人服务员的态度都非常不友善！欠他们几百万酱紫！再来食物自己没介绍好menu，怪顾客自己点错，一句道歉sorry也没有.点了5样食物，来了两碟，等吃完了才来另外两碟，吃完又来最后一碟face_with_rolling_eyesface_with_rolling_eyesface_with_rolling_eyes四周还一股臭味扑鼻thumbs_downthumbs_downthumbs_down,wong Kx
Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),1,"I worked in a famous seafood restaurant in Singapore where 90% diners came for chilli crab. Came to try chilli crab in Todak and we asked for 800-900gm crab. But when it was served, it looked much smaller than the requested size. It looked like 650-700gm only. I'm very certain they cheated on the weight of the crab.",Nikki Law
Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),1,This is my first try and the last food. The food is bad. I won't recommend it to my friends.,Jeslyn Gan
Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),1,"Went for lunch today , ordered a crab and a red leopard grouper with 2 bottles of beer . Total coat RM415 for 2 pax . Crab was terrible wrong due to only shell and not fresh , is totally not from what i picked from the display tank . Fish was ok taste and no complaints. Not the first time visit but this might be the last time . Totally disappointed and not worth the time and effort travel there for such a dishonest restaurant.",Victor Foo
Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),4,Come early before sunset for dinner if you want fresher & tastier seafood. Lesser crowd as well. Service was decent. Overall experience was satisfying & affordable.,Felisciana Nyangun
Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),1,"Don't spend your money HERE ! ! Paying superior price and get super low quality food. Don't order crab here! - crab meat with slime - shell is big, once open up meat is smaller than anchovies - crab probably dying soon or already dead Told front desk about it, they dont even bother to explain,  only ask me how I want to make payment! Spend RM410 for 2 pax lunch ! Sucks food, bad experience, no service at all !!  Will update my review if I have any food poisoning issue",caely tham
Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),2,"Been many times, but my recent visit just 2 weeks ago was a big disappointment! The crabs , 1 piece were nt so fresh, the fish was bad, as it was overcooked n texture was rubbery! The Live prawns were NOT fresh at all as it was not caught live from the tank whn we were there! Very dissatisfied n disappointed!! We feedback to e staff and they were totally defensive and dismissive, rather than offering an attempt to understand or address the issue. There was no effort made to offer an apology or a form of compensation which made our experience more frustrating. When we asked for some compensation in e form of some discounts on our total bill, the reply we got was , “We r just workers, the boss is not around”! What kind of attitude n standards of service is this??",Jen Chan

Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),3,Crab is nice. The rest of the dishes are average.,KIN
Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),1,The food is ordinary and not very delicious. I saw dead crabs in the basket. I don’t know if it was cooked for customers. The service attitude is very poor. I can’t call it. I can’t get it. I didn’t take it seriously. I can’t call it. I can’t call it. I don’t recommend it. There is still a choice next door that is not his room. Then it’s very dark pink. I can’t see the food. . .,Jared Tee

Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),1,"From the pictures and word of mouth, it is just bad, the people are atrocious, the food looks bad, even the people around feels bad.",tricia lee
Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),5,Was a little unsure about the reviews but was glad we made it. We arrived when it was low tide and as one other reviewer mentioned the garbage is exposed and the place looks dilapidated and filthy. However the restaurant itself is actually pretty clean including the toilet. The pricing is very reasonable and transparent. The seafood is very fresh and tasty. I did find the seasoning a little too heavy but overall happy with everything. Will love to return.,Charlee November
Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),4,"I recently visited this restaurant. A spacious and clean seafood restaurant that serves no pork and no lard, making it suitable for a wider group of diners.  The restaurant is located slightly inside the area, but it's worth the trip. They have a wide variety of live and fresh seafood to choose. All the seafood are market price. Freshly catch and will be weigh in front of you.  The food was great as always, which is why I visit regularly. I especially enjoyed the Teochew steam fish and soy sauce prawn. Prices are average and reasonable for fresh seafood.  Staff were friendly and attentive and service was good.  A great place for seafood lovers—definitely recommended!",Andrew Lim
Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),1,"I was recommended this restaurant by a saloon and wanted to try out the seafood. When we got there it was low tide and it didn't look appealing at all with all the trash in the water.  Service was non existent, find your own seating was the theme. Most of the staff were there to just carry or clear food and not much else.  Do not buy the satay or otah from one of the sub tenants. Total garbage, otah was more flour and colouring and had barely any fish, satay meat was cheap frozen chicken or meat with a lot of greasy fat.  I saw a lot of uneaten otah and satay sticks on many of the tables.  Price wise for 1.5 kg black pepper crab, mapo tofu, Kang Kong and some Chinese lettuce came to RM360. Which was expected for the quality.  However, if you included the time to drive there, it's a barely pass if u're looking for cheap food, if you're expecting decent quality or service, give this place a wide berth especially if getting a grab out of there will take hours of waiting as it's far from the city.",Dylan Lee
Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),4,"Reservation is a must, if not have to come earlier to find seats. Best to come before sunset.  Seafood by the sea,  very fresh seafood where u get to the items u want.  Must order the Black Pepper Crab, Steam Fish, Gam Heong Lala.  You get to order Satay too but by another vendor. The mutton Satay is so good!  Overall a good place to dine with family.  We had 1 chili crab, 2 black pepper crab, kam heong lala, steam fish, 2 vegetables, man tou + rice for 6 pax, total about RM945 including beer and drinks",MEY (Mochima)
Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),1,"one bite of the fish, and i felt like im under the sea.",Yun Yee
Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),3,"Service is quite chaotic. u have to find yr own seats first.. then queue to order yr seafood.  The place is full of mosquitoes so be prepared to be stung whilst dining.  The road into the restaurant is quite bad.. quite sandy and not paved properly.  At peak hours there is no parking available outside..  They don't use digital weighing scale to weight ur seafood and they weigh with the pail. so not very accurate.  If u want to dine there, order the crabs and live sea fish.. the prawns are not live and some are mushy.  the soya sauce for steaming the fish is too sweet.. overall not a very pleasant place to dine at",Jon Peng
Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),5,"The seafood was absolutely wonderful. For 16 pax, we split into 2 tables and ordered similar dishes for both tables.  - Hotplate tofu - Drunken prawn soup - Fried baby squid - Kungpao chicken - Sambal kang kong - Garlic kai lan - 20 pcs of shelled scallops in total - Big head lala - 1.5kg red grouper - Fried crayfish  Some drinks included",terry tan
Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),5,"The road leading to the restaurant is kind of rough. Have to drive slowly as there are pod holes along the way. Food is nice. We ordered baby kailan, drunken prawn and 2 medium size crabs. We chose the crabs to be cooked in black pepper and chilli. The black pepper is very tasty. Whereas the chilli crab taste so so. It is different from the Singapore chilli crab style. The sauce is more watery. Taste kind of like tom yam. Drunken prawns are fresh. Customer service was OK. Atmosphere is OK. The restaurant is on a platform stretches out into the coastal area. Pricing is OK.",Sam Lee
Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),5,"thumbs_up The seafood here is super fresh and the portions are really big—great value if you’re coming with a group of at least 4 people. Prices might seem high at first, but once you see the portion size, it makes sense. Definitely recommend for seafood lovers who enjoy sharing dishes!",Angel Tam
Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),3,Since 2002 loyal customer to this restaurant but the taste of the food not like last time.,Retnam Ramesh
Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),3,"We arrived at around 5pm for an early dinner so not much crowd. Love the view overlooking Sembawang Park. Though, we were kinda disappointed because we were not advised on the weight of the seafood we chose before it was cooked. Staff also recommended an alcoholic dish despite knowing there was a Malay patron without informing that dish used cooking wine.",Nurul Hidayah Kamari
Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),1,"The difference! Apart from the difference, it’s still a difference! I haven’t made any progress after so many years. The crabs we ordered have died for a long time and are still smelly. We obviously lived when we chose it. As long as we know what magic we changed in their kitchen. . What's worse is the attitude of those employees. . We gave a report that they were not happy, thinking that we would complain after eating the smelly crab. face_with_spiral_eyes was speechless. Later, I looked online and found out that we were not the first table to encounter this situation, but the store had no intention of making changes. . . Awesome. . .",Kelyn _c
Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),4,"The food taste has improved since the last time i been there.. the previous time several months ago was a disappointment. Pricing is ok. Paid RM300 total for steam fish (750gm), curry prawns, fried eggs, veg, hor fun and 3 beers for 4 pax.",Men Shiang Loh
Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),2,"I came here after hearing so much about the place..it’s quite famous and the scenery is undeniably beautiful. But sadly, the food was a big letdown. The Tom Yam soup was really bad and totally unacceptable. The Lemon Chicken had no salt at all, very bland. We ordered two types of fish, the 3 Rasa was way too sweet, and the ginger steam fish was just average. No fruit juice available either.  Honestly, it’s not worth the money. You’re paying for the view, not the food. Won’t be coming back",kriatini ranjan
Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),3,"The food is fine, the food is not marked",jiajin lee
Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),1,"The three sweet potato leaves have stones inside. The store later changed a new plate. The sand pot and tofu on it later had iron wire frowning_face. It was a disappointing experience. The key orders were all the employees who looked like they were the boss. Improper. The crab said 158. If you choose, it was 178.",Shu Hui

49 SEATS,1,"how can you call your carbonara a carbonara when you drown it in a ton of cream and your sauce is not even that good, the meat is not even guanciale and it looks like some ham looking meat if it was bacon i could still say that its okay but no weird meat inside, there was nothing in the carbonara that i can even justify and say that its good and its 20 dollars. im sorry but i cant say its good",Brian Yeo
49 SEATS,4,"Ordered the carbonara seafood. Sauce is creamy enough and there is plenty of clams in the pasta dish.  However, the pasta is on the pricier side... After gst, almost all of their pasta dishes will cost more than 22 dollars... i also felt a bit thirsty after eating the food.",Hong GZ

Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),5,"Quite cheap to eat Seaafood especially crabs. Kamheong tastes good, but I don't prefer her egg sambal crab. Parking is wide and if many people are a little fierce. You can see view of Sembawang Industrial Area Very close one",Asikin Aziz

Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),4,Went with some friends. Really enjoyed the deep fried sea bass. It was so fresh and tasty. Also enjoyed the spicy prawn dish (forgot the name). The prawns were succulent and sweet.  However the drunken prawns were a disappointment. The gravy tasted like plain water with a little hint of rice wine while the prawns weren’t as good as the first prawn dish.  Likely to come again with my family.,Joanna Peck
Restoran Todak (Orang Asli),5,"The seafood was really impressive! The crab was fresh and the meat was tender and sweet. The tiger prawns were also very fresh, with a firm and juicy texture. The butter squid was rich and flavorful — perfectly cooked! We also had the chili sweet potato leaves, which added a nice spicy kick to balance the meal. Overall, a satisfying and delicious seafood feast",魔鬼中的天使

49 SEATS,4,"What we had:  Lunch Set (11.30am to 5pm) - Starter, main dish and drinks - $17.90  1. Tom Yum Seafood Pasta Visual: 4.5 5 Taste: 4.5 5 Creamy, spicy, and tangy — the taste and quality have been consistent for years. This is my go-to dish every time I’m here. I’ve tried tom yum pasta from other places, but this one’s my favorite. The amount of seafood is impressive too — I’m not even a big seafood fan, but I always manage to clean my plate. Chef’s kiss. Nothing bad to say about it :)  2. Cheesy Chicken Chop Visual: 4.5 5 Taste: 3.5 5 Generous portions — the plate was bigger than we expected! Lots of crispy fries and coleslaw to go around. Unfortunately, the chicken sauce tasted more like pizza sauce, giving it a pizza-on-chicken vibe. It lacked depth and the “wow” factor was mostly from the portion size. We probably wouldn’t order this dish again.  3. Cheese fries (ala carte $9.90) Visual: 4 5 Taste: 4 5 Looked awesome and tasty! Best to share with more than two people — we couldn’t finish it all and appreciated that the restaurant was happy to provide takeaway boxes. It’s a bit pricey, but when shared among a group, the cost is manageable. Plenty of sauce, both cheese and mayo — loved it!  TIP: Visit during their lunch hours for the set meal — it’s definitely worth the price then!",Jehu Limang

I came for the famous Tom Yum Seafood Pasta and it absolutely lived up to the hype — rich, creamy, spicy, and packed with fresh seafood. The Smoked Duck Pasta was another highlight — tender, flavorful, and surprisingly well-balanced.  Service was friendly and attentive, and I liked the chill industrial-style decor — cozy enough for a casual date or gathering with friends. Prices are reasonable given the portion sizes and central location.  Would highly recommend if you’re looking for something different from your usual Western or Asian fare.

Colony,5,"What's to say, but the utopian buffet experience can only be had at the Ritz Carlton Sunday champagne brunch.  From fresh seafood to curated cocktails, you'll be sure to get a bang for your buck if you visit on Sunday for their brunch. Most buffets claim spreads, but the Colony Sunday brunch promises quality of the spread.  Only here can you get bespoke service, where they encourage and entice you to try their 3 cocktails, 2 champagnes, red and white wines, and at least 4 fruit drinks, including the different waters from sparkling to distilled. And if you're lucky to get NingNing, you've won the lottery for the day.  She's the Sunshine of the Colony, and brings you warmth and a personal touch that makes you feel like you've got your personalised butler service. Don't worry about changing plates, or getting wet ones, or cutlery to dig out the delicious crab. She'll get them for you, and with a smile.  Thank you, Ning Ning, for a memorable brunch. We come back because of excellent service from people like you.  A shout out to Tin, Rethish, and Angie as well. You're the stars of Colony.",dt seluj

Colony,4,"Airy, upscale hotel eatery with 7 open kitchens, plus a la carte meals & a generous global buffet. The Colony buffet at the Ritz-Carlton is generally considered a top-tier buffet experience in Singapore, known for its diverse and high-quality food, elegant ambiance, and attentive service. We were invited for dinner by a friend of ours. Loved the ambience  service and food. Two guys at the Pasta section ,took good care of my dietary requirements when I told them make Ravioli for me. They were careful about not adding onions and garlic etc I liked it. The guys at the Pizza section didn't want to make any pizza when I requested for a vegetarian one,not sure what's the point of having a live station catering to diner's needs. They just pointed at a few slices on display which didn't look appetising, so I moved to Pasta section. Desserts and fruits were fresh. At the other sections, food was being replenished in time. Indian food section was untouched,looked full except diner going for mutton and tandoori chicken. Couldn't take photo of the food,will capture it next time. As a vegetarian who doesn't take onion and garlic,there were some options for me like salads, breads, pasta etc. Couldn't find any vegetarian soup as both the soups which were available had meat in it. Loved the architecture. It is wheelchair accessible. Buffet Dinner at Colony (Sundays to Thursdays) Available from Sunday to Thursday from 6 p.m. to 10.30 p.m.The dress code is Smart Casual. Slippers and activewear are not permitted. Covered shoes are required for gentlemen. Thank you for the top tier dining experience.",Ms. Suchi Singapore

Colony,1,"Just had the most horrible experience at Colony - Ritz Carlton. I had called the hotel asking for availability for breakfast to take my family there for a celebration. On arrival, the staff rudely just refused a table. The restaurant had many tables available. She just told us that it will get busy later.  No apologies. No one came to help or explain.",Mahesh Pratapneni

Colony,4,"Really dislike how the space is extremely crowded, with tables placed very close to each other. Definitely the worst environment among all the fancy buffets in Singapore. The food is fine, and the desserts are especially good, but I would not return because of the overall setting.",Cindy Jiang
Colony,5,"Tasty food especially the Singapore Heritage Corner featuring duck, chicken, roast pork and char siu (must try!), loved the rojak too for the thick rojak paste used, enjoyed butter chicken, Salmon, Carbonara pasta, Iberico Pork was tender and flavourful, great drink options especially the fruit juices and enjoyed the desserts like Oreo vanilla ice cream and caramel ice cream and gula Melaka cake bar. Special mention must go to the ever-present service staff who were always around clearing plates promptly and refilling of water, excellent service indeed! The Colony delivers an excellent dining experience!!",Chris Zee
Colony,2,"The space especially the sushi section , the walkway so narrow and the snow crab and seafood section also kinda narrow. I have eaten many buffet oversea n locally. This the only one I found they dun even wash or clean the oyster shell.  Most of the oysters I took the shell all have sands like never wash beside they peel open. Not a good experience on a 5stars hotel can improve on it and most oysters in hotel I eaten they have prepare and it's nicely off the meat from the shell.   And during the buffet I have diarrhea need to rush for wash room . 1st time I having diarrhea dying a buffet section same with my friend who I treated him for his birthday dinner.  The jackfruit on fruits section is a plus point. Mention: the fried hokkien mee is surprisingly delicious with wok hei.",Casey Khoo

But when the employee who took my card when I calculated, I didn't come back for a long time, and I didn't try to meet with me even though I passed by many times in front of our table.

Colony,4,"First time trying this place, recommended by friends. We purposely came on Friday night where they served seafood buffet. Understand Sun-Thurs may have some 15% discount for certain credit cards, but no discount on Fri and Sat.  Basically, there are 3 main section of food, the desserts, the cold dishes and the cooked food (together with fruit juices and fruits).  I must say the selection of food is great, but considering the price per pax vs quality , I give it a 4-star only. Some of the food item is quite disappointing, such as the lobsters, al of us concluded the sauce taste funny, and we had to specially asked for it without sauce. The oysters and crabs are fresh though.  The environment is nice and cosy, but t think they placed too many tables, resulting the walkway between tables are narrow and can be dangerous when you move with hands full of food. I give it a 4-star.  The staff are friendly and helpful but they lack of some product knowledge, and we had some Hard time checking on discounts, and almost needed to avoid our payment. 3 of us paid for $425  Plentiful of parking at the hotel car park and they do give complimentary parking ticket.",Chris
Colony,5,"Went for buffet lunch today and I must really praise all the staff for their top notch services and attention.The Colony's atmosphere is good, not noisy even though is full house and space in between tables is not cramp. Though the buffet ended at 2.30p.m., the staff allow us to sit till 6p.m. before their dinner commencement. Really appreciate their kind gesture and thoughtfulness.  The international buffet has a good range of dishes to choose from. The cold prawns and crab are really fresh likewise for the sashimi. If you like ""hum full"" laksa, this is the place for it. Lemak gravy which has the old school taste. Thanks for the good experience today. Reservation recommended.",Kckcchuo@gmail.com Kckcchuo
Colony,5,Had a great experience at Colony today buffet lunch! Was served by Saidu with customer centric service. He surprised us with the birthday cake when we asked for a group picture.

Colony,5,"On the last day of summer vacation in Singapore, I was looking for Singapore food and accidentally found a Colonie buffet. Really lucky, I watched the GS60th anniversary firecracker event near Ritz Carlton on the day of the reservation and went to have a dinner on the last day of the birthday trip :) As soon as I went in, the name led Lee Lee was so kindly guided and the first Singapore trip. You did it. So I couldn't remember the real name. He would introduce the food culture properly and brought a little bit of food from various chefs and chefs. The food is so colorful, delicious and beautiful as it is multinational!  I was curious about the crab that I couldn't eat until the last day, but Yong Wei Chef introduced the crab dish and tasted a huge crap. And because of the coloni with a lobster, Chef Sanghyuk brought a lobster grilled with plenty of mozzarella. It was a nice Korean! So I explained a little more detail :) And Hui Jun, who gave me a very fresh oyster and shrimp mussels, Richard chef who tasted baked ducks, Danish chef who gave me the taste of the skewers that I had really delicious on the first day with Real Singapore Sate. I would have praised me if I hadn't come. It was a very happy time to find out all these situations and food that I didn't know and to know Singapore better.  Oh, if you go to the salad corner, Hui Jun is doing food like a Singapore salad called Rojack, but I was really delicious and impressive. I hope you eat it with peanuts and vegetables and fruits. If you eat it, it is Singapore Conquer!  The quality of the food and the service are too best, so Colonie also said that it was a hotel buffet, and even though it was a hotel buffet, so many people used so many people to know why the reservation was so full.  Until I came to Singapore, I didn't really expect it, but I wanted to come back to Singapore again by meeting the friendly and friendly Singapore Coroni staff who informed me of food culture. If you come to Singapore, I will stop by. thank you!",BOYEONG LIM

Colony,5,"Visited Colony on 12 July 2025 with the wife. After making a reservation, I was contacted by one of the staff and advised that I could arrive earlier if I wished to so that I would have more time for my dinner. Of course, I gladly obliged and changed my reservation to an earlier time. Upon arriving at Colony, the wife and I were seated promptly by their manager and a server immediately came to our table and explained the place to us. Service was impeccable; plates were cleared fast, serviettes were replenished before we finished those given and lemon water and scissors were brought to us minutes after my server noticed that we had taken crabs prawns. As we were slightly into our dessert, a birthday cake was brought to our table unprompted; a level of attentiveness that surprised us. The food was great but the oysters that night were sandy and unfortunately gave my wife a stomachache the entire night. Atmosphere was as what one would expect from a higher-end buffet although I found the seats were too close to each other.",Sam
Colony,5,Truly excellent take on local food. Sashimi was also top tier.,Josiah Tan

Make a reservation weeks in advance if you are planning a special date or you’ll miss out. It very popular.",S
Colony,5,"We had a pleasure to hold our department lunch (20 paxs) at Colony last Friday. Ambience and selection of food are great. They seated us in a private section of the restaurant which we did not expect. Freshly made pasta, laska and tiramisu and many more. Staff are attentive, helpful and friendly, especially Rudi. Will try out their seafood buffet soon. Do note that if you have a big group, advance 50% deposit is required to secure the reservation.",Karenlyn Roxanne Ng

Colony,5,"We had a delightful experience dining at Colony while celebrating a birthday. Kent and Saidu took excellent care of us. They were warm, attentive, and made our afternoon feel special. A thoughtful touch was that the kids were given colouring sets as they were starting to get a little restless, which helped keep them busy and allowed us to enjoy the rest of our meal.  The food was delicious with a good variety, and there was something for everyone. We all left feeling happily full and satisfied. Definitely recommend this place for a gathering or celebration!",Lynnette

Colony,5,"One of the best buffet experiences I’ve had! Colony offers an absolutely top-notch buffet — the variety, quality, and presentation were all outstanding. Every station had something special, from fresh seafood and perfectly cooked meats to delicious international dishes and a dessert spread that’s hard to resist.  The ambiance is elegant but comfortable, and the staff was incredibly attentive without being intrusive. Everything felt well-organized and fresh, with constant refills and spotless serving areas.",liv octavia
Colony,5,"Tried a number of hotel buffets in Singapore and got to say this one is most worth the money spent.  my favourite is the japanese cruisine bar, sashimi thickly sliced, sushi rice was nicely seasoned and fluffy, not hard like rice cakes.  the oysters were fresh and plump, decent size! prawns fresh too so easy to peel, none of them were mushy.  dessert bar so amazing, literally wished i left tummy space for this. we all know lots of hotel buffets dont care about dessert selection as long they look good but taste like cupboard cakes from some random factory, but Colony has dessert that you know are definitely crafted with care!",Bimbles
Colony,5,"I visited The Colony twice, first for a lunch buffet and second for a dinner buffet and the food is spectacular. They serve with a smile and try their best to make you feel at home.  Restaurant manager Tessa recognised my friend and I on our second visit and warmly welcomed us back. She even made the effort to start small talk and that made us feel even more at home.  We would recommend the colony to anyone looking to eat fresh seafood, delicious array of dishes and receive excellent service. We will be back!",Dann Ziq
Colony,4,"Spent a lovely company lunch at Colony today. First, I was greeted by Bastien who assisted me with my bag. He was very chatty and lively. Next I had trouble finding the entrance and confused it with Republic as it was my first time there. A very nice staff member named Aurie helped me find my way. She even agreed to take a picture of me in front of the venue. Overall, the food was very good. I loved the fresh salmon, the kurobuta pork with caramelized onions and the desserts, especially the tiramisu, gula melaka cake and green tea cake. The cherry tropical ice cream was amazing. However, some items were a bit lacking, especially the crispy pork which had more than 50% fat in each piece. Very classy and thoughtful staff (they even brought a stool for my bag that I had placed on the floor when I was away finding food). Thank you Ritz!",Eloïse
Colony,5,"Was at Colony for a buffet lunch few weeks back and Dhiva was incredibly attentive to our table, always there when we needed something without being intrusive.

Colony,5,Went here for the lunch buffet. Reservations are required as it is very busy. There is a wide array of food available. The noodle station makes the noodles which includes laksa and fish soup a la minute. The laksa had a good flavour and nice lemak to it. The fish soup was full bodied. Satay was quite good. Desserts were varied from kuih to cakes and you can get the ice cream popiah which is something a bit different. Everyone was queuing for the fresh seafood as well. Service was friendly and efficient and the ambience was nice.,E
Colony,5,Simply the best Sunday brunch in terms of quality of food hands down. The seafood which comprise of premium lobster and alsaska king crab is the best in Singapore.  Yes its very expensive at $228++ but you get quality and goes with great service. It's a real treat. I ate here at least once a month and never been dissapointed.,Yue Huan Lee
Colony,5,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at The Colony, and I must say the experience was truly outstanding.

The food selection was impressive and of exceptional quality, catering to a wide range of tastes. Each dish was well-prepared, flavorful, and beautifully presented.  What truly made the experience memorable was the impeccable service provided by the staff.

Lighthouse Bistro,3,"I have dined at Lighthouse Bistro for nearly 20 yrs. It used to have a members 4 Course Lunch  month at a discounted price . However since Covid, not only the quality but also the format for the member's lunch changed. Now it is a 3 Course Lunch offered at a higher price. I visited the place a few days ago & was very disappointed by not only the quality but also the quantity of the offerings. The Main Dish was very reduced in quantity & the Dessert was 1 2 of what it used to be.  The saving grace -is that the Service is still very good. They added a New Dish -Plant based Meatless burger which is terrible as the Patty was ""Dry"" & made out of Mushroom & Soya! (not like the beyond meat burger). Overall a disappointing Bistro now.  Lighthouse Bistro has been a nice Restaurant in the past. But since Jan2023, standards have dropped & it has now become an average restaurant. The prices have been raised steeply, the ""Members"" monthly menu reduced from 4 course to 3 course, quantities   dish portions reduced & overall quality average. Further the place has only two stereotyped veg dishes- Pasta & Fried Rice for a number of years & it seems the Management is ""oblivious"" of the changing tastes worldwide, where these days ALL Restaurants in West have atleast 25%-30% Veg dishes in the Menu! Further All Restaurants in West have NO HALLAL but only Veg, Nonveg dishes..unlike in Singapore...where Vegetarians are forced to accept what is available..however mediocre the dishes & quality are. Restaurants like Lighthouse Bistro should have more variety & courses for Vegetarians , compared to Non Vegetarians as vegetables cheaper than meats & more healthy.",C S S Rao
Lighthouse Bistro,5,Fantastic welcome. Table for 2. Beautiful menu. Fish and chips absolutely amazing. Batter to die for. Tirramisu to finish and boy what a finish with a kalhua bath.

He was quick to notice when we were ready to order, or needed extra chilli sauce etc. The portion was huge. The Ale battered fish & chip was crispy & the dough tasted really nice. The calamari was also very crispy & delicious, no oily after taste. The sapphire bling had an interesting & refreshing taste to it which was nice. The restaurant had a quiet relaxing atmosphere. It was a pleasantly enjoyable dinner & great place to catch up.",J G
Lighthouse Bistro,5,"The food was Amazing, the mushroom soup was a great starter. The seafood platter enough for 4 people to share was awesome, prawns, muscles, squid & battered fish stick was a beautiful way to start the meal.  The came the ribeye steak, juicy, succulent, tender & flavourful and accompanied with fries....oh lala!!  If that was not enough, my wife and I had Anglehair mee goreng which, was piping hot and a must have. Never thought that this would taste so nice but trust me it did. Infact, every dish we had was lovely. Been sometime since we ate at a place that all the dishes we ordered was soooo nice.  To top it off, the service staff was first class, professional,  attentive, warm and a shout out the Ken. Ken's the man, he provided an amazing service throughout dinner. Thank you Ken.  You can be sure I'll recommend this wonderful place in all aspects to anyone asking for a great restaurant. Oh yes and the price is not gonna make you fall off your chair. It is reasonable, fair and worth the money. An amazing restaurant, soft music, a place fit gir dignitaries....provided they don't mind it not being in the heart of Orchard...hehe!!",Schoen Karl
Lighthouse Bistro,5,"I recently celebrated my friend’s birthday dinner at Lighthouse Bistro, and it was an absolutely delightful experience from start to finish! Our server, Ken, provided top-notch service, attentive and friendly. The food was nothing short of spectacular. The sous vide ribeye was cooked to perfection, tender and bursting with flavor, while the scallop pasta was executed flawlessly, with every bite a savory delight. The sea perch stood out too, beautifully presented and seasoned just right. And the truffle fries? They arrived in a generous, towering mountain, fried to crispy perfection and infused with that irresistible truffle aroma. The drinks were expertly crafted and paired wonderfully with the meal. Overall, it was a fantastic night filled with great food, impeccable service, and a warm atmosphere. Lighthouse Bistro made the celebration truly memorable!",Goh WL

Really good quality shrimp covered in a garlic spicy crunchy sauce topped with croutons and spinach.  It's was not overly spicy, just slightly spicy. The serve was great and attentive.   guess what? i went back the next day for lunch and got the spicy shrimp again, and everything was still the same great service and great food. Thanks",april thomas

Hua Yu Wee Seafood Restaurant,1,"Wasn’t able to try their food despite having a reservation. :( Service staff would just ignore your presence (for as long as possible it seems) and when we were brought to our table (meant for 7 pax), there was only 1 chair - service staff didn’t even try to take chairs for us. Furthermore, be prepared to be a buffet for mosquitoes confused_face",Benita Loh

Hua Yu Wee Seafood Restaurant,4,"This is your local, above average seafood restaurant. At times, the restaurant can be crowded and wait times a can be at least a good 15min. I love how the restaurant provides many different flavours for the crab. The seafood was fresh, sweet and juicy, and melted in your mouth. Every spoonful I took made me want to go for more. Orders could be mixed up at times, but all you have to do is alert the waiter and they will be there promptly, they are very apologetic. I definitely recommend to all seafood lovers!",Jacob Cheong
Hua Yu Wee Seafood Restaurant,4,"Came here with my family for dinner.  Coffee ribs were great, robust flavour and good texture. I liked their orh nee too. Nostalgic place overall.

Lighthouse Bistro,5,Enjoyed lunch at this restaurant nestled next to Citylights condo opposite Kitchener Complex. It's cozy and gives a family feel. Food is just-nice portion and price is reasonable. The beef steak option of the lunchtime special is awesome! Lighthouse smoothie is a must try. Fish and chips and assam mee goreng pasta are great! Attentive staff plus NTUC member discounts...overall great lunch experience!  Will return.,Alan Wong
Lighthouse Bistro,3,Food is average.  Mee goreng angel hair was a little sweet for me and the sotong was a little burnt. Interesting as they used angel hair as the noodles.  Har cheong chicken fermented prawn paste taste is not as strong as I would like.  Service is very good.. congrats to the service crew.,Jon Peng
Lighthouse Bistro,5,"Came here with a large group of people, so I had the chance to try a variety of dishes!  I liked most of the food, except maybe the mushroom soup as it tasted a bit bland for me. But the lava cake was the one that left me the greatest impression- it is probably the best lava cake I’ve ever eaten! The presentation looks great, and the fruits were all really fresh and sweet. The cake also had good moisture, unlike most lava cakes out there.  Staff are also really attentive and were also very elaborate when I asked them for recommendations for a drink.  Price is definitely on the higher spectrum so it would make a fancy place for a date!",Faye Yap (叶栩绯)

Colony,1,Food quality dropped a lot. Some of the seafood are not fresh especially the crab and snow crab. Prawns are still alright. Roast meat sections lousy meat are very oily and the taste is not right. Roast duck taste blend. Char siew the spice taste is too strong. Lots of MSG cos I am very sensitive to it and felt thirsty after the dinner. Compared to pre Covid-19 era which is much better. Only stuff that I find it nice is the Laksa and Mango Passion fruit sorbet.  But service is top notch flexed_biceps,Adrian Wee
Colony,4,"Good variety and quality of food, very fresh oyster and shrimp. Love the pork rib,nice flavor.Will come again",Audrey
Colony,3,"The oyster  (big n plump) and salmon sashimi (seafood sweet) are good n fresh.  Understand that they had switched their oyster supplier to the US.  Previously the oyster was just average.  Good management decision to switch to a better supplier that provides big n deep based oyster.  I had eaten slightly over a dozen for my weekday dinner buffet.  The snow crab claws   pincers was tasty with seafood sweetness.  I don't usually eat snow crab as it can be really messy n may chip off your teeth.  But I certainly enjoyed the snow crab claws!  The plain water were served without any slices of lemon.   Incredible service for this highly rated hotel.  Anyways the staff had quickly served on a small plate a few slices when I made the request.  The service staff were attentive to take away side plates when these were full including the wrapping of the Japanese chopsticks.  Very professional guys.  Kudos to all of you for making my dining experience at Colony god in this aspect.  Some were chatty as they engaged us in small talks.  As for the other foods, the choices are pretty limited n tasted just average.  Should revamp the types of dishes to give these an atas taste as well as look n feel.  There was no udon or ramen or cold noodle at all!  Just unbelievable!!!  The sushi were so hard n not placed in a mini fridge after these were made.  How to preserve the freshness of Japanese sushi!!!  These are coming from me who is a lay person in F&B.  The honey comb was pathetic n barely sweet and tugged away in an inconspicuous corner that I missed out until my wife told me!!!  Promised to replace my small bottle of honey to go with my camomile tea but one of the caps was so tight even the waiting staff n my strong n young son cannot even open it).  The bottle of honey unfortunately was forgotten by the waiting staff n we had to share those bottles that were opened.  The Chinese food especially the roasted duck n char siew are so average n the soup (black bean) was so disappointing.  Dim sum was very disappointing n the attitude of the chef making the Chinese noodle for a hotel like Riltz Carlton was wanting n lack professionalism!!!  Pastas n Indian food offerings were slightly above average.  Overall, I don't get good vibes for my the dining experience here n maybe because I had previously made several visits before.  Hardly any glamour n let alone looking forward to yet another visit.  Buffet at Pan Pacific (although rated as one star lower) had alot of offerings.  Really good value for the food.  Maybe I had a better experience there.  May have to look for a good alternative given my last experience at Colony that was not great at all except for the oyster n salmon sashimi",David Wong
Colony,1,"PARASITES FOUND IN FRESH OYSTERS  I have emailed your establishment in Jan 2025 to formally express my concern following a dining experience with multiple parasites found in oysters. Unfortunately, I have not yet received a response.  During our meal, I selected three oysters from the rack and immediately noticed a large parasite swimming inside one of them (approximately the size of half a strand of spaghetti). I was shocked and shoved the plate to your staff, who acknowledged the issue.  Subsequently, I was assured that three new oysters would be provided. I inquired whether these had been thoroughly checked to ensure they were free from any parasites, and your team confirmed they had been inspected.  However, upon consuming one of the replacement oysters, I observed a parasite swimming inside again. This recurrence is deeply concerning and raises serious questions about the sourcing and handling of your seafood",Amy Chang
Colony,1,"Only Good seafood, don't go, not worth it, I won't even bother.",Stephen Procida
Colony,5,"This was definitely one of the best buffet i have tried so far. The buffet offers a variety of different food of different taste and style. For example, there is Indian, Chinese, Japanese and American food. My personal favourite is the sashimi from the Japanese section and bread from the bread section. There was also free flow  juices to drink from. However, as I am a kid and I love sweets and gummies, I was a bit let down by the desserts in the desserts section. There was too little toppings for the ice cream toppings and there was no sweets. There was also no chocolate fountain and marshmallows. (No hate) The service was great, the staff is warm and friendly. They always clear the plates and pour water in our cups when there is no more water left. Overall, I think this was a good buffet and I hope it can improve on the dessert section.",Cayli Yong

He was incredibly fast, always attentive to our needs and making sure we were comfortable throughout the meal. It’s rare to encounter someone so dedicated to providing such a high level of hospitality. Colony Restaurant should be happy to have a meticulous staff like him. Thank you for making our dining experience truly memorable!",Janice
Colony,1,"Came here to dine with my family twice. On the third time, everything seemed fine until the food. My brother's girlfriend felt off after eating the oysters and I myself have the runs after eating their food. Don't know whether it is the seafood or what. Other than that, the previous times the service was good but our waiter make some comments about us like ""somones thirsty"". I understand the jest but I dont really think it is an appropriate setting to make such comments. Other than that, we ordered two pots of chamomile tea, but the same waiter got our orders wrong and served us two chamomile tea and an earl grey tea. Really hope it was an off day for this place as i really like to come here.",Liew Kenyun

When I asked service for lobsters, they say that it depends on availability and they replaced it with vegetable pizza??? I mean are you fr!?!? We went for seafood of course, why on earth would we spend$114 person and take an hour’s transportation for VEGETABLE PIZZA? We could have had that at Dominos or Pizza Hut!!! We chose Colony between many other buffets like RISE and EDGE, I checked their menu, called staff to make sure there was lobsters but no at all when we arrived! We were so disappointed since we literally came especially for the lobsters. I just don’t know what to say, if you’re going to make a fake menu and trick people to nothing, that’s def a fraud. Don’t go, DO NOT BELIEVE WHAT THEY SAY!!!",Allen Xu

Parking was easy since ATP is quiet on non-working days, and the outlet is tucked between Blocks A & B. Most eateries were closed, so this was a nice find.  The café has a cosy, minimalist vibe. We ordered the Ebi and Fried Chicken sandos. The bread—soft and buttery like brioche—was definitely the highlight. Sauces were flavourful and well-balanced. Unfortunately, the patties themselves (ebi and fried chicken) were quite bland on their own, relying heavily on the sauces to shine.  I had flat white and the coffee is smooth and fragrant.

Food wise, portions are generally smaller though prices are lower(so you will need to order larger portions). Taste wise, I must say do not order scallops (frozen, tough and tasteless) they are not fresh, coffee ribs is quite sweet, prawn heavy msg taste...very average food quality.  They are very quick to wanna get you to leave. Booking for 1.5hrs, family dinner, 1hr they will start to clear your table with two servers.

"SANDO at Alexandra Technopark (Japanese Sandwiches, Coffee, Craft Beer... some say Burgers too.)",5,"Shared the Hoki Fish and fries ($16.80 + $3) with my partner and both of us were really wowed by it! Think not one, but two thick breaded fish fillets which was flakey and delicious, made even moreso with the fresh crunchy cabbage and an addictive tartar sauce. Highly recommend and we think it is worth the price. Although, the quality and quantity of the fries was slight regrettable for the price, so would not recommend adding it on. They have an extensive selection of sandos so we're excited to return whenever we're in the area!",Darren
"SANDO at Alexandra Technopark (Japanese Sandwiches, Coffee, Craft Beer... some say Burgers too.)",4,"Not bad. I was going to rate it as 3, but my wife really enjoyed and said 4.

"SANDO at Alexandra Technopark (Japanese Sandwiches, Coffee, Craft Beer... some say Burgers too.)",4,"If you are a fan of sandos, you can enjoy fairly good tasting ones in a cafe which is rather awkardly nestled in a very office area. The parking signage is pretty bad for someone who is unfamiliar with the area and entered the sheltered carpark instead. Really difficult to get lots in the sheltered carpark, so turn up towards the slope which leads to an open-air carpark. See my parking tips.  While the tonkatsu sando and crispy chicken wingettes were well-flavoured, I was super thirsty within an hour after the meal. The bun was also rather underwhelming, and seemed to taste like normal bakery buns. Perhaps their donburi would be better, which wouldn't match the name of the café!  For coffee, the Spanish latte tasted average. The mild aroma of the coffee beans is good for those who do not want to return to the office with strong coffee breath!",Avril Atkeg

Hua Yu Wee Seafood Restaurant,5,"An old family favourite in the East, this restaurant has been a weekend staple for years. For some strange reason, we would willingly squeeze in with the crowds, just like many other families. Reservations are highly recommended, almost mandatory.  It used to be far more chaotic, but they have now streamlined their processes with three dinner seatings: 5:00pm, 6:30pm, and 8:00pm. If you are in the first slot, parking is usually available. For later slots, be prepared for the traffic jam outside the restaurant before being able to hand your car over to the valet.  Once inside, everything runs like clockwork, as long as you manage to catch the attention of the waitstaff. If not, you risk wasting precious minutes from your 1.5 hour dining time, as dishes do take time to arrive.  The atmosphere is incredibly lively, ranging from crying babies, the occasional semi-tipsy uncle, and the chatter of families over food.  As for the menu, our staple includes the coffee ribs, black pepper beef cubes, prawn rolls, vegetables with shark cartilage broth, and of course, the crabs. We usually go for the chilli crab, which tastes more tomato than chilli, but is already spicier than elsewhere. The black pepper crab is a strong contender, though it can be a bit too pepperish at times.  All in all, a good place for family dinners, but if you would prefer to avoid the crowd, consider going on a weekday before 6:30pm.",MH Tham
Hua Yu Wee Seafood Restaurant,4,Service needs to improve.,Rishi Kumar
Hua Yu Wee Seafood Restaurant,4,"Seafood very fresh.  Only issue is, every staff is so busy and no one to provide directions or help to take orders or clear tables. Eg. When we first arrive at the carpark, it was unclear that we needed to go through right to the back and 'catch' a willing staff to Show us to our table (with reservations). They forgot about my baby chair which i did indicate during reservation so imagine the fluster with one adult getting the highchair and trying to clean the chair and other to ensure baby doesnt struggle too much.  We had to wave very hard to grab a staff attention to take our orders. Food is served relatively fast though.  When i want to make payment, i couldnt find a staff so i walked up in front and was asked to sit back at my table for someone to assist.",C W

Mee goreng using angel hair was a very bad choice.  Too sweet and pasta very soggy,  had to throw away as too sweet to eat. Sotong was like rubber.  Can’t recommend though waiter was superb and polite though he kept missing our table’s requests.  Prices are high for bistro, and food worse than hawker quality.",Chinese Moon

My boy totally love the Mango Day Spring as it is absolutely refreshing.  I totally love my latte with the taste of Bailey. Totally aromatic and the blend of latte with Bailey is so well balanced.

"SANDO at Alexandra Technopark (Japanese Sandwiches, Coffee, Craft Beer... some say Burgers too.)",1,"13 December. I tried the brisket, fish and beef patty burgers. Burger buns were average. Fish is real fish meat with some ""fishiness"". Beef patty was weird that was deep fried with some batter . Brisket was the worst . It was like steamed slices of meat with fats that made it really hard to chew. All the burgers had its own distinctive sauce that didn't really go well together as a burger. Portion was big though. I felt that probably there was some fusion somewhere but the sauces, meat and buns didn't go well together.",Wei Meng Tay

The moistness, crunch and juicyness of that menchikatsu is in a world of it's own. The balance of the pickles and sauce gives the Sando that tarte flavour that cuts the grease of the katsu. Not forgetting the cheese melted inside the katsu.  Although an eastie myself, this sando place is one worth travelling to the west for!  Sando 5+ 5 -- honestly think this might be the best sando place in Singapore period.",Christian Villanueva

I got the fish burger - it’s like an elevated version of McDonald’s filet o fish, with chunkier (and fresh) fish patties. Great burger bun, also liked the slaw though it would be nice to have a little more to cut through the greasiness.  Tater tots tasted how you’d expect tater tots to taste. The mushroom fritters were fried well, but too greasy and the batter was too thick.  We also tried a few drinks - matcha latte, hojicha latte and royal milk tea. Matcha latte was pretty good. The hojicha latte is on the sweeter side. Royal milk tea is the most unique drink of the three, with a nice tea fragrance.

We spent over $600, and not a single dish was good.  The black pepper crayfish had no black pepper taste and was mainly sweet sauce.   All the dishes looked good and were cooked well but the taste was off...again too heavy handed on sugar and black sauce. The service was horrendous.

We ordered the lamb shank, ribeye steak along with 2 mocktails. Mocktails and food came within 15min after we placed order!  Lamb shank was tender, with slight gamey taste but still very acceptable! I quite enjoyed this dish and especially like how each component (sauce, mashed potatoes & veg) is well integrated together without getting too heavy.  Ribeye steaks were tasty with medium rare doneness but a pity that the black pepper were overly charred resulting in bitterness on the steak. Hence, I didn't enjoy this dish as much.

Got the platter, the fish is battered nice, prawns fried nicely, the mussels taste so good with the sauce but whatever the sauce is (think it's garlic something) mixed with the squid is so dem good, ya can dip the fries or anything in it and it will be good!  The calamari with buttermilk cream is very good too, it just meshes very well with the buttermilk sauce.  Next up is the classic lamb shank, ok this is an all star. Firstly the meat is superbly tender, secondly there is no gamey taste of lamb and thirdly the sauce brings everything including the potato mash and veggies together so well.  Lastly is the lava cake and ice cream for desert, both paired very well with each other, the creaminess of the ice cream and the savoriness of the choc lava cake.

Our experience with service at Singapore cafes and restaurants before Fiamma wasn’t great - but this place goes above and beyond to ensure you feel special.  The complimentary bread and oil was a lovely touch. We ordered the burrata della costiera to start and the burrata was so fresh, as was the dressing, it went perfectly with the bread. I then ordered the ziti alla genovese pasta - the ragout just melted in my mouth. My husband had Diavola pizza which had so much flavour. As we left, we were so happy and full that we left our bags at the table. DaVinci ran after us to ensure we didn’t forget them.

Our server was attentive, noticing dietary preferences we didn’t communicate, and was knowledgeable about the menu. The staff also gave two desserts for my mother’s birthday, as they noted some of the guests didn’t like cheese.  However, the food is where Fiamma fell flat. We had started off strong, with meatballs and búfala cheese as the appetisers, and they were fantastic. The mains left much to be desired, with the pasta being overcooked to the point of mushiness, and the seafood unfortunately was not the freshest.  Thank you to Fiamma staff, who made the experience enjoyable nevertheless. It goes to show that service can save what would’ve been a gastronomical nightmare.",Abby Ng

The blue lobster was fresh, and the pasta was cooked to perfection — though for my personal taste, the sauce was a touch too creamy. The tiramisu was outstanding, with freshly made cream that was light yet indulgent.  Service was excellent — the wait team was warm, professional, and incredibly accommodating, making the experience feel polished and welcoming.  The only downside was the small flies that joined us throughout the meal when seated outdoors, which was a little distracting. I’d recommend choosing an indoor table for a more comfortable experience, and I do hope the restaurant can address this, as everything else was truly exceptional.",Ankori

Their menu offers a delectable array of dishes that will tantalize your taste buds and leave you wanting more.  One standout dish is the VITELLO TONNATO, a beautifully prepared veal dish served with a rich and creamy tuna sauce. The combination of flavors is exquisite, making it a must-try for any gourmet enthusiast. Additionally, the TOMAHAWK WAGYU SANCHOKU is a true showstopper. This premium cut of beef is cooked to perfection, offering a succulent and tender experience that is simply unparalleled.  For pasta lovers, the SPAGHETTI “MONOGRANO FELICETTI"" is a delight. The spaghetti is cooked al dente and paired with a flavorful sauce, creating a harmonious blend that is both comforting and satisfying. The MARGHERITA Pizza is another highlight, featuring a thin crust topped with fresh, high-quality ingredients that make for a perfect balance of flavors.  Lastly, the Parmigiana Di Melazane - Secondi is a vegetarian dish that should not be overlooked. The eggplant is expertly cooked and layered with cheese and tomato sauce, resulting in a dish that is both hearty and delicious.

Fiamma,5,"I had the pleasure of dining at Fiamma at Capella, and I must commend chef CK for an outstanding culinary experience. Every dish was beautifully presented and bursting with authentic flavors, showcasing both creativity and respect for traditional Italian cuisine. The quality of ingredients and the Chef CK’s attention to detail truly set the meal apart. It’s clear that CK is passionate about his craft, and it made our dining experience exceptional. Highly recommended for anyone looking to enjoy an unforgettable meal at Capella!",Emily
Mellben Seafood,4,"Do not come here on a weekend. The walk in queue was 2 hours long, had to wait 1.5 hours for food. They do tell u to expect this wait, so it’s no surprise, but this wait wasn’t exactly worth it for the food in my opinion. Horrible service, they absolutely cannot cope.",Deborah Chan

Mellben Seafood,5,"Mellben Seafood serves up irresistible crabs—think super crunchy cereal prawns and rich, creamy crab bee hoon soup that’s absolutely comforting. Their chili crab is tangy, spicy, and packed with flavor, perfect for mopping up with mantou buns. If you want those big, meaty crabs, remember to pick yours early—these giants get snapped up fast!",Travel Foodies
Mellben Seafood,4,Crab is fresh,Jasline Tan Tan
Mellben Seafood,4,Crab in vermicelli soup was really good. The soup has a very intense flavor. We had two small veggie side dishes which were good but indeed very small. Recommend getting medium at least. Their service is pretty basic to say it nicely and the atmosphere is nothing special. We came on a Sunday at 17:00 and immediately got a table. The restaurant filled up towards 18:00.,Matthias Thul
Mellben Seafood,1,Highly not recommended. Crab is below average.,Kale G
Mellben Seafood,4,Food is not too bad. Good service.,MooMoo Cow
Mellben Seafood,1,"Hi, I’d like to share some feedback on the chilli crab I had today. Unfortunately, it wasn’t fresh and tasted quite different from what I’ve enjoyed here previously. The quality was noticeably below the usual standard, which was disappointing—especially considering the price point. Hope this can be looked into.",Lena Tan
Mellben Seafood,3,"Crab was good and that’s the only good thing. We ordered 10 dishes, the clam was dry, the fried chicken coating was thick, and the cereal prawn had an overly sweet flavor. I would recommend here if you only order crab and set lower expectation for rest of dishes.",Siliang Liu
Mellben Seafood,5,"First day in Singapore and went to Mellben for an early dinner to beat the crowd. There are 3 crab meals you need to try but we can only order 1 so we started things off with the popular Claypot Crab Bee Hoon soup. You can select the weight of the crab depending on availability. Got the Signature Deep Fried Homemade Beancurd and Scallops & Asparagus with XO Sauce for some greens. A cold bottle of beer seems right for the moment. You can get a glass of water for free but adding ice will cost you a little. The beancurd which measure 3x1x1 is huge and chunky with a crispy texture on the outside but soft and chewy on the inside. Its really good and a must try. The soup from the claypot carb is so rich and tasty, its almost a meal on its own. Probably good if paired with a cup of rice to soak up all the juice. Its one of the best crab meal I ever had in Singapore and I still haven't tried the spicy or butter crab meal yet. Payment is made at the counter after you're finish. Cash payment instead of card will get you additional discount. Digital payment not accepted here. Inside the restroom washing  area is a picture wall of diners who FORGOT to pay and just walked away. Such a shame as this is such a great place to have a crab meal. Staff are so helpful and efficient so lets all play fair. As Mellben is located on the lower floor of an apartment residential block away from the Orchard strip... travelling here is a 20 to 30 minute taxi ride. Getting back is harder even if there's a bus route nearby. Best option is to book on a ride-sharing or taxi app. Truth be told.... after having this delicious crab meal everything is now downhill at this point. A queuing booth in front of the store tells you that despite its  a big restaurant will lots of seating area... there's quite a wait during peak so try to come early and avoid the big crowd. If you have read my review up to this point.. Its a must-visit. Bring a couple of friends and order the Clay pot, Butter and Spicy Crab trifecta. A few bottles of cold beer and there you have... a very satisfying if not the best crab meal in town.",DanAGo

Fiamma,5,"We had a lovely breakfast experience at Fiamma. The restaurant offers a wide range of selections, and every dish we tried was exceptionally good—fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented. The warm and welcoming service made the experience even better. Special thanks to Jason, Melvin, and Manish, who were all incredibly friendly and thoughtful. Their attentiveness and genuine hospitality really stood out. Highly recommend Fiamma",Luis
Fiamma,5,Cautionary tale: server’s recommended wines are 50$++ per glass versus under 25$ for menu wines and cocktails. Rest of the experience is amazing. Great food and one of the best service in Singapore. Also the ambience is a vibe. Overall loved it.,Saurabh Mudgal
Fiamma,5,"Dining at Fiamma was a deeply satisfying and well-paced experience that showcased both culinary finesse and exceptional hospitality. I started with the veal and pork meatballs, which were rich, comforting, and set the perfect tone for the meal. The tartufo pizza delivered beautifully balanced flavors — indulgent yet refined — and the pasta courses, especially the capellacci ravioli, were delicate, fresh, and artfully prepared. I ended the meal with their cannoli, which was crisp, creamy, and not overly sweet — exactly how it should be.  What truly elevated the evening was the incredible service provided by Mr. Ahad. From the very start to the end of the meal, he guided every course with precision, helping me choose the right wine, manage portions thoughtfully, and ensuring each dish was sequenced and placed perfectly. His presence made the experience feel curated and seamless. Thank you, Mr. Ahad, for making the meal feel not just delicious, but deeply considered.",Sai Snehith Mallareddy
Fiamma,5,Amazing food and cozy ambience! For appetizers pesto burrata was excellent and the rock melon salad was simply refreshing! Will always end the meal with their classic tiramisu that is enough to share with two!,Sherman Robert
Fiamma,5,"Fiamma has always been my fav dinning spot on Sentosa. Their warm, Italian family-style is elevated by an emphasis on seasonal freshness. Every dish feels thoughtfully crafted and rooted in tradition. And what makes our every visit a memorable one is the genuine warmth and attentive service from Shahie and his team. Kudos to Ahad! His thoughtful gestures didn’t go unnoticed. As he moves on from Capella SG next week, we want to wish him every success in his journey ahead.  Thank you Shahie and team again for continuing to deliver beautiful dining moments that keep us coming back.",Justine On
Fiamma,5,"Visited in early July 2025, and I can confidently say that Fiamma at Capella delivers one of the most memorable Sunday brunch experiences in Singapore.  Nestled within the lush grounds of Capella Singapore, the ambience is both elegant and inviting — airy, refined, and perfect for a leisurely afternoon. It feels like stepping into a sophisticated Italian home, with thoughtful touches that elevate the overall atmosphere.  The brunch itself is a celebration of Italian flavours and craftsmanship. From fresh seafood and crudo to beautifully roasted meats, handmade pasta, and indulgent desserts, every dish was thoughtfully prepared and full of character. It’s a place where rustic Italian soul meets contemporary finesse.  Equally impressive is the level of hospitality and service. The team is warm, professional, and sincerely attentive. They strike a perfect balance between polished service and heartfelt care.  A special thank you to Mr Da Vinchi, Beatrice, Sarah, Mr Kumar, and Mr Shahie for their outstanding service — their presence truly enhanced the experience.  If you’re deciding where to spend your next Sunday, Fiamma’s brunch offers more than just a meal — it’s an experience of comfort, elegance, and authentic Italian generosity. Highly recommended.",C L (CL)

I had one of my best Italian dinners in Singapore since 10 years! A truly genuine Southern Italy culinary tasting from “pizza fritta” to Ziti alla Genovese, paccheri alla Amatriciana and “dulcis in fundo” Delizia al Limone!

Fiamma,1,"When the blue lobster pasta first came, we got a whiff of a strong pungent smell coming from it. We still gave it a shot only to realise the pasta had a really fishy smell and taste to it. Furthermore, the lobster meat itself was incredibly mushy like a paste, probably lobster that was not fresh. We expected the lobster meat to be fresh and firm as we’ve never tried lobster meat this mushy and bad. Afterwards we enquired from the man wearing a blazer, he told us that the pasta sauce was broiled with lobster shells and heads, thus the smell. (However the smell was more unpleasant rather than fragrant.) He also said that the lobster meat was “intentionally cooked this way” to be mushy… (Not sure if well cooked lobster meat is supposed to be so soft that turns into a paste as I’m under the impression that fresh lobsters generally  have a  slightly more firm and pleasant texture) The man also did not seem open to receive feedback from us on how we feel about the pasta so we did not want to continue talking to him about it.",Lululu
Fiamma,5,"Fiamma, a dining concept by the celebrated chef Mauro Colagreco behind three-Michelin stars restaurant Mirazur in Menton, France ​ was simply astounding. Had the polpette meatballs, great tasting veal meatballs in basil-ginger tomato sauce. Had to savour every bit of that sauce with the complimentary bread that came along with the starter. Had the blue lobster pasta and the Tbone. The lobster had roe which was indeed blue in color and was served in a cast iron pot. Half a lobster was provided and it was succulent. Extra point for the sauce. T Bone was done right, medium cooked to perfection with right amounts of fat. Last but not least was the tiramisu and to top it off we had wonderful service from our server Vinci and the rest of the service staff which made the night ever so memorable. Will be back for their extensive Sunday brunch",Irving Goh
Fiamma,5,"Celebrated wife's birthday at Fiamma and absolutely loved the food. The service rendered by the Supervisor Mr Kalai were simply the best.

Lighthouse Bistro,3,"Came over for dinner and ordered their signature lamb shank and souve ribeye steak. Firstly when we enter, we caught the whole staff resting. They were all surprised to see us. Thankfully their response was prompt and professional so a plus! Service was impeccable and efficient. Everything was done right from service to accessories for dining. Price wise was also on the affordable side and menu has a good variety. Portion sizes were good too except for the sauces which were given sparingly. Taste wise was okay but not impressive enough for a star. Their signature lamb shank was disappointing as the texture was rough and powdery. Meat was too dry for my liking. Souve ribeye steak was nicely medium rare and the crust was done right. Except for the cut may be too lean for my liking and also too much tendons within the meat. So no star here. Ambience was good and seatings were spacious. Everything was fine and we enjoyed the dining experience except for the meat took us a long while to chew.  Overall a good 3 star rating and towards the 4 star. Hopefully the signature dishes get some improvement and same for the ribeye.",Scott Ng

"SANDO at Alexandra Technopark (Japanese Sandwiches, Coffee, Craft Beer... some say Burgers too.)",5,"Exquisite Japanese sandwiches using freshly baked shokupan bread, premium ingredients, and specially concocted sauces!  At Sando, the star ingredient is the shokupan, a Japanese milk bread renowned for its softness and slight sweetness. Made from an enriched dough, this bread is fluffy, moist, and incredibly soft even after toasting. Each slice is thoroughly buttered and toasted to perfection – soft in the middle, lightly crisp on the edges, with a rich buttery flavour. This dreamy bread forms the perfect base for Sando’s delightful creations.  June’s Manager’s Meal – Ebi Baddie Sando  Shrimpy Patty, Hashbrown, Spicy Peach Salsa, Truckloads of Cheese, Lemon Vinaigrette, Lettuce  The Ebi Baddie Sando is a burst of flavours and textures. The succulent shrimp cutlets are crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, with a prominent torched flavour that adds a smoky dimension. The spicy peach salsa introduces a sweet and fruity profile, perfectly balanced by the bright, zesty boost from the lemon vinaigrette. It’s a complex yet harmonious blend of flavours that left a lasting impression.  Tamagoyaki Sando  Tamagoyaki, Japanese Curry Egg Salad, Katsuobushi, Napa Cabbage, House-made Tonkatsu Sauce  This sando is an umami bomb, thanks to the savoury tamagoyaki (Japanese rolled omelette) at its core. Flavored with dashi stock, the tamagoyaki has a slightly sweet taste and custardy texture that pairs wonderfully with the Japanese curry egg salad. The katsuobushi and napa cabbage add depth and crunch, while the house-made tonkatsu sauce ties it all together. The strong dashi flavour might be overwhelming for some, but it’s a must-try for umami lovers.  Har Jeong-Aage Sando  Shrimp Paste Fried Chicken (Har Jeong Kai), Atchara, Cheddar, Overeasy Egg, Honey Mustard  The Har Jeong-Aage Sando is a delightful fusion of flavours. The shrimp paste fried chicken is juicy and flavourful, thanks to a savory marinade. Paired with atchara – fresh and crunchy pickled green papaya – and the creamy overeasy egg, each bite is a delightful mix of textures and tastes. The cheddar adds a rich, creamy layer, while the honey mustard provides a sweet and tangy finish.  Sando’s dedication to quality and craftsmanship is evident in every bite. From the softness of the shokupan to the thoughtful pairing of ingredients, each sando is a testament to the simplicity and joy of good food. Plus, with islandwide delivery and pickup available, along with a reasonable delivery fee of $8 (or free delivery for orders above $120), you can enjoy these delicious creations from the comfort of your home or office.",Zi Xuan Lee
"SANDO at Alexandra Technopark (Japanese Sandwiches, Coffee, Craft Beer... some say Burgers too.)",3,"Recently went on a sando spree. So I decided to check out this joint. Sadly, the quality of the food could be better. But generally I liked the vibes of the place. The crew was cheerful and the deco was classy.  Tonkatsu sando Pork could do with more seasoning. Batter wasn’t well done. Didn’t taste Japanese at all. Over fried.  Yakitori chicken sando A bit better than the tonkatsu. But still lacked seasoning. Didn’t give me the Japanese vibes at all.  Tator tots Not seasoned enough and over fried. Could be due to old oil being used. I can’t confirm this.  Corn croquette Not too bad. But the corn kernels felt a bit hard. Again tasted of old oil.  Espresso Sour type. Didn’t like it. But that’s purely personal as I prefer nutty beans.",Terry Chua

Mellben Seafood,5,"I only recently discovered this restaurant and now I understand why it’s so popular. Every dish I ordered was absolutely worthy of a 5-star rating. The service was fast and efficient, making the experience even better.  I had the stir fried kailan with garlic, creamy butter prawns, salted pork ribs, and black pepper crab. The crab was impressively large and packed with meat. I usually brace myself for black pepper crab to be overwhelmingly spicy, but this one was perfectly balanced. It was just the right amount of heat to bring out the flavors without overpowering the dish.",Rebecca Hoang
Mellben Seafood,1,"Bad service. The staff were very rude and unable to speak English. Although they were just workers, they acted entitled. When we asked questions about the sizing of the crabs, they told us to just look at the listing ourselves, which we found confusing.

This well-established gem has maintained its consistency over the years, serving up hearty, flavorful dishes that never disappoint.  Two signatures we always come back for: the buttery crabs and crab bee hoon. The buttery sauce is luxuriously smooth with a nutty depth that clings beautifully to every bite. And the crab bee hoon? Comfort in a claypot—thick vermicelli steeped in a rich, umami-packed broth that warms the soul, especially on rainy days.  If you’re after a no-fuss, satisfying crab feast, Melben delivers time and again.",Jiak Pa Liao

Mellben Seafood,1,"The food was decent, but the overall dining experience was extremely disappointing. Before I even arrived at the restaurant, the waiter who spoke with a northern Chinese accent pressured my friends into ordering an excessive amount of food and kept encouraging them to add more dishes. As I arrived and requested to adjust the order, another waitress responded with a rude and unfriendly attitude, completely lacking in basic customer service. It ruined the excitement I had for dining at this highly recommended restaurant. The only redeeming part was the owner, who handled the bill at the end with professionalism and warmth. Unfortunately, the frontline staff’s poor attitude and the lack of service awareness sharply contrast with the owner’s demeanor, leaving a seriously negative impression of the restaurant as a whole.",Emery Kwong

Their bread is easily my favorite I’ve had in any sando ever, and their monthly specials and pop-up events keep things exciting even when you’ve made your way through the menu as many times as I have.  It’s clear this is a business run with passion and love — and I’m sure you’ll want to support this friendly neighbourhood sandwich shop regularly too, if only you can brave the trip to the slightly inconvenient location the first time.",Angad Srivastava

Fiamma,5,"Some dishes is like really super good. Meatballs is a must-try, carpaccio is decent. Pizza is very good. The tomahawk is pretty good - one of the best in singapore. For this price is even better.  Servers are enthusiastic and very on the job, even though the restaurant is very busy. We were privileged to be served by D*** (the Pakistan guy from Hong Kong), And also by several other servers on other occasions during our stay, They are all very professional. They know their dishes well and is not shy to recommend.  The sommelier lady is very professional also.  I will come back again.",J

Fiamma,1,"Went for dinner and had some wine last night at Fiamma. There were two bottles of red wines we took some time to finish. At 10.30pm, one of the male servers rushed to clear my empty glass without if it was appropriate to do so. The glass that was cleared was for a different red wine, and there was some wine left in the bottle (it’s for a Nero d’Avola), The existing glass I had was for a Brunello di Montalcino.  I understand that the restaurant needs to close by 10.30pm but there is no need to be hasty about it. When I asked if I could sit outside for a short while and finish up my wines, I was given a negative answer and the glasses and wines have to be cleared.  No one checked on us to see if we could be made more comfortable by having our wines being corked and taken away in a carrier bag until we asked for it.  For a restaurant in an exclusive hotel like Capella, the service is rather appalling. What would have been a good night out was left with a slightly bitter aftertaste.  Jerry Gwee, IWS, SWS, FWS  (P.S. There is only one standard sized wine glass for white wines. Bigger reds like Barolos, Super Tuscans, Brunello di Montalcinos, Chianti Classicos all deserve wine glasses with bigger bowls for the wines to breathe and showcase their aromatics well. Standard sized wine glasses detract from the experience of enjoying these wines, especially when they are priced high.)",Jerry Gwee
Fiamma,5,"My experience at Fiamma wasn't just a meal; it was a deeply cherished moment shared with my mother. The extensive menu offered a delightful array of choices, and the staff were incredibly kind and patient. They gently guided us, offering personalized recommendations, even explaining the loving care that went into each dish's preparation.  The food itself? It transcended mere sustenance; it was an experience.  Each bite felt infused with homemade warmth and genuine passion. I especially remember the Polpette—tender meatballs brimming with herbs and spices, served with a rich, flavorful sauce—a taste sensation I'll long remember.  A huge thank you to Vinci Bartol, Kumar, Bastian, Chef Antonio, and Chef Lim for making this such a special occasion for my mom and I.  It's an experience I'll treasure forever.",Aaliyah Zaid

Fiamma,4,"We had dinner on a Fri weekend and received  immaculate service from the Filipino waiter. We order the parma ham, grilled octopus, ribeye, red prawn, 2 pizzas, lobster pasta, tiramisu. Everything was great except the red prawns, which was very little and underwhelming.  It came up to about $130 per pax w o wine. Overall, we felt that it was a little expensive. Perhaps, it was located in Capella Singapore.",AdventureFair
Fiamma,5,Great place to hang out with family and friends! Great food! Very high quality and service! Will go back again for sure!Wilson,Ng Wilson
Fiamma,5,"We had an absolutely wonderful experience at Fiamma thanks in large part to our waiter, Da Vinci. From the moment we were seated, he made us feel genuinely welcomed and cared for. His warm demeanor, attentiveness, and deep knowledge of the menu truly elevated our brunch.  Da Vinci struck the perfect balance between professionalism and friendliness—he anticipated our needs and made my wife’s birthday celebration memorable.",guoyong fu
Fiamma,5,"Everything was great about this place, the T bone steak with a portion of filet mignon was 100% perfection. Perfectly seasoned, tender and juicy. We got this medium rare btw! We love every bite. It was by far the best steak we’ve ever had!  The tiramisu was also delicious. We ordered it along with a twisted pasta and were absolutely stuffed after the meal.  Great place for an important dinner, or special occasion, the ambience was cozy and feels luxurious. We will definitely come back!  Thank you Chef Antonio and the service crew for the memorable night. sparkles",Spice

Fiamma,5,"Service was fast! Very friendly staff and every dish we ordered was delicious. Every dish was fun to eat and we had the opportunity of trying familiar foods in new contexts. Each dish had depth and unique flavors. Every dish was plated and presented beautifully as well I went there as a birthday celebration with my girlfriend and they made the effort to accommodate to the celebration despite not being obligated to. Da Vinci (hope this is the right spelling) who served us throughout the night was kind and welcoming, making the vibe a warm pleasant experience. Will definitely come back to try more.",Daniel Alex Chia
Fiamma,5,"Had 2 wonderful dinners with our dog during a stay at Capella. The fish of the day (in a Ligurian broth), calamari pesto nerano vongole pastas and ribeye steak were outstanding. Special shoutout to Ahad and Ross who took good care of us and were attentive throughout. Got a birthday surprise each time too which was much appreciated.  Only feedback is (1) portions for the appetisers and protein for the pastas are small and can be more generous, and (2) outdoors can be humid warm (they provided a cooler fan but got warm towards the end although that was partly cos of food and alcohol).  Overall we enjoyed ourselves and will be back~  PS: pls excuse the terrible photos",C J

Mellben Seafood,5,"This was by far the best chilli crab I’ve ever had! I even ordered a second portion because it was that good. The crab was fresh, the flavor was outstanding, and the fried mantou made everything perfect.  Price-wise, it’s quite affordable by Singapore standards — I spent around $300 for 4 small crabs, along with mantou and tofu, which comfortably fed four people.  Tip: Be sure to call ahead and make a reservation to avoid long waiting times — it gets busy!  I’ll definitely be back for another visit!  Nearest MRT: Marymount",Jessica Natania

From the moment we arrived, we felt genuinely welcomed by the restaurant manager, who made us feel right at home. After a few minutes, he kindly introduced us to Chef Antonio, and that truly elevated our experience.  The food was exceptional, especially the paccheri pasta, which was perfectly cooked and full of flavor. Chef Antonio is not only a talented chef but also a fantastic entertainer, adding a special touch to our evening.  I want to thank the entire team at Fiamma for making our night so memorable. It was a fabulous experience at this magical restaurant, and we look forward to returning soon!",toni rossetti

Mellben Seafood,1,"I am a very fair person. The food is honestly good. However the service and restaurant policy is rubbish. So for this reason we are giving them 1 star review. We were there on 2nd April 2025, for dinner at 730 pm. We were a 2 pax party. We wanted to order 2 different cooking styles of crab. The staff told us that each crab has to be above 1kg for them to cook one dish. The staff told us to select our own crab. We selected a crab that was 900g, almost 1kg. He said  they cannot cook the dish if the crab is less than 1kg. He told us to reselect the crab. He refused to select the crab for us. He insisted we select the crab ourselves. We ended up selecting 2 crabs that weigh 2.8kg. For 2 pax, this is a lot. However we were very hungry so we decided to just go ahead with it. We brought a bottle of wine, and our own wineglasses. The restaurant wanted to charge us corkage of $12. The crabs for 2 pax was $330. We felt that as a goodwill gesture it would have been nice if they waived the corkage for us, given that we brought our own wineglasses. We decided to order their house wine which costs $50. The staff served this wine and did not even bother to bring wine glasses for us! Frankly we were so fed up that we decided to just enjoy the food and make this the last visit here. Even though the crab dishes were good, the service and restaurant policy really left a bad taste in our mouth. We definitely won’t be back here again.",Dr Wee Lyn Teh
Mellben Seafood,5,"Their White pepper crab and curry crab is a must try! The standard of food is just as good as I remembered trying it for the first time in my childhood years when they were back at Serangoon. The place is clean and well ventilated, staff are polite and helpful. 10 out of 10 will return when I need to satiate my crab cravings.",Esther Lim

From the moment we stepped in, the warm ambiance and impeccable service set the tone for a memorable evening.

But the real highlight was meeting Chef Antonio, whose passion for authentic Italian cuisine shines through in every dish. His creativity and dedication are truly inspiring.

Fiamma,3,"We had gone to this restaurant – all the way on a stormy evening with very high expectations considering it was part of Capella and highly rated. However, the restaurant did not live up to its expectations. Over all the food was quite uninspiring. The vegetarian pasta was quite insipid and the pork ribs were overdone. The only good thing was the wine – thanks to Sarah, they could not have really spoiled it.Overall, a very average restaurant.",Manjit Rajain
Fiamma,5,"Had a wonderful first visit to  Fiamma Capella. Ahad our host, was warm, attentive, and made us feel very welcome.

The ambiance was equally delightful, offering a warm and inviting atmosphere that complemented the meal perfectly.  The service provided by Vinci and Ahad was outstanding; both were highly professional, courteous, and attentive throughout the evening. Additionally, the manager personally came by to ask if we were enjoying our meal, which was a thoughtful and appreciated gesture.  Altogether, it was a memorable dining experience.

Mellben Seafood,5,"This place is renowned for its signature crab bee hoon. While the fried tofu, a personal favorite, was slightly disappointing this time around (their previous version is super good!), it's still a must-try. Don't miss the exceptional white pepper crab as it’s one of the best I've had!  Be prepared for long queues and waiting times (at least an hour) during peak hours.  Tips! Paying via cash gets you 5% off the total bill!",Eileen T
Mellben Seafood,4,"A little pricey, not too packed on a Wednesday night. We ordered the crab beehoon and chilli crab, minimally per dish, you need to order one medium or two small crabs. We got 2 small crabs for both dishes and it was too much for 6 of us to finish. The crab beehoon was great, the soup broth was super thick and flavorful. However the chili crab fell short of our expectation. It was not as spicy and flavorful. Nonetheless it was a great dinner and will still recommend it to friends.",Stella Tan
Mellben Seafood,1,"Finally had a subpar experience at otherwise solid Melben. They changed our order without telling us - ordered female crab, were served male. When we asked about it we were told they were out of female, which would have been nice to know when ordering. On top of that our crab was served cold, within 5 minutes of ordering, and the chili sauce was separated.",Jerry Pisk

Jai Thai,2,I was at the Clover Way last night and one of the dishes I ordered was the pineapple fried rice which I usually order. To my surprise the rice were all clumped and tasted like an overpowering turmeric rice with a few thrown chicken slices and countable pineapples.  Will definately give it a miss.,Helen
Jai Thai,4,"all dishes were very flavourful but may be bordering to salty if not taken with rice. pandan chicken was a must order, clear tom yum soup perfect taste and the tapioca with coconut milk was just right. Minced chicken in basil leaf was a rice stealer (but quite oily at the end) along with the green curry chicken, stir fry kangkong had too much sauce and appeared a tad salty if not taken with rice.",Kgirl 001
Jai Thai,4,"First time there, all dishes were very flavourful. The pandan leaf chicken was nicely grilled and clear winner, the tom yum clear soup was just the right taste (not too sour nor sweet), the green curry chicken looked oily when served but had greate taste and good amounts of vege, the minced chicken basil leaf was a little oily (best taken with rice else salty), the fried tilapia fish sauce was a little sweet but otherwise good, the stir fried kangkong could have been a little less salty else all were rice stealers. The red ruby was perfect (not too sweet)  although the pieces mango felt a little dry. The cendol had a bit too much coconut cream and a tad sweet. But overall was a satisfying meal. Would come again with family",Kgirl SG
Jai Thai,4,"Food standard varies, some days good some days not good. I ordered ผัดกระเพราไก่ basil with chicken and fried kangkong. I asked for less salty but the foods were still too salty for me. However, the fried egg was dripping with oil and overly deep fried with charred edges. Foods here are reasonably tasty but not exactly the best or authentic Thai food as most reviewers claimed.",Mandy

Jai Thai,3,Decent offerings but not as the signboard says. It's halal so fans of Basil Pork rice will have to go for Basil chicken instead. And it doesn't come with an egg.  Their Tom Yum was still good. Get the red one.  I was surprised they don't offer the iconic Thai Lime steamed fish. They only have a fried version which was strange.  Pandan chicken was a little dry too.,Uncle Tan
Jai Thai,4,"Ordered 4 dishes. Kai lang, Panang dried curry chicken, tom yum chicken clear soup and fried beef with pepper garlic for $40.  The taste of the dishes are superb. However the quality of the meat was so bad that i cannot over look. Chicken of tom yum was the worst offender. It was just so tough. Beef has too much tendon and the stuck in between teeth. Dry curry chicken was barely average. Kai lang was great.  Taste wise tom yum was quite authentic which beef was great. The goat was the dried curry chicken, it was so coconutty one of the most flavorful sauce.",Super Fragrance

When we informed the waiter, he offered a replacement, but by then, the issue had already ruined our appetite for the entire meal. We didn't accept the replacement nor were we offered a refund. While we appreciate the gesture, the lack of quality control in the first place was unacceptable. This experience has left us hesitant to return.",jove tan
Jai Thai,4,Love this place since it was at Thomson plaza. Good prices with great flavour.,Yvonne Xinyu Yeoh
Jai Thai,4,Place look basic but the taste is not too bad  Pineapple fried rice got the taste and not too bad.  Tom yum clear soup normal spicy got kick  Prawn cake is not bad though I feel abit greasy  The Pandan chicken I find it so so only though it’s signature. It’s abit hard m flavor so so  The kangkong is avg,M P

Jai Thai,5,The standard is still as high as it was 6 years ago! thumbs_upthumbs_up  Their red curry & basil chicken dishes are a must try!,Tryphena
Jai Thai,5,Huge and clean place for family. You are greeted when you enter the place and immediate given a seat with ipad for ordering. The online menu also have option for less spicy if there is chilli in the dish. Potion of each dish are huge and taste good.  Only concern is its hard to find parking in the area as its locate in landed enclave. Recommend to drop by if around the area,Steven Soo
Jai Thai,4,"Looking for authentic Thai food, look no further. Recommeds the fried fish, prawn cakes , veggie ,Tom yum gong soup, pineapple fried rice, Thai milk tea and fried egg.",Andy Chua
Jai Thai,5,Food is consistently good with many choices of yummy Thai food at affordable prices. Winnie makes us all feel welcome and at home everytime we are at the restaurant. Outstanding staff with terrific service. Highly recommend for Food and Atmosphere.,Ellena Lew
Jai Thai,4,Food is delicious BUT for takeaway it is ridiculous. The absolute smallest container size. $9.50 for the thai basil chicken rice in the smallest container possible (about 1 3 the size of your standard tze char box) is a scam. It's about 60% of the amount of small for dine-in.. Boss please correct this - won't be a return customer because of that.,Mr A
Jai Thai,5,"This place is a gem for anyone who loves Thai food! We had the Pad Thai, and it was hands down the highlight of our meal. Super flavorful and tasted authentic!  We also went with a set menu that came with pandan leaves wrapped chicken (which was super unique and so good), fried fish, a single spring roll, and green curry. Everything was tasty, but that pandan chicken really stood out for us.  Honestly, for what you get, the price is totally worth it. The food is good, and it won’t break the bank. Definitely recommend this spot if you’re in the mood for some solid Thai food!",Hui Ming Chiak
Jai Thai,5,"Great food, intimate family style restaurant. Green curry is a must try. Would also recommend the pineapple rice.",Kai
Jai Thai,2,I’ve been eating at this place for close to 10 years and it’s really authentic Thai. The food is great but the decor could use a refresh.  Parking is also terrible at this location so try to beat the crowd if you can! Another bad thing is the ordering system. Staff will make noise for sending multiple orders! Unfriendly staff always deserves a bad rating.,Eric Lee
Jai Thai,5,Food is amazing for it's price! Had Thai basil rice with green milk tea and it was great thumbs_up highly recommend!,Tyler Tan
Jai Thai,5,Shop location would be inconvenient if not driving. Parking lots around the restaurant are limited too. Ordered the Thai basil rice and Tomyam soup. Portion is good for its price and both of them are delicious! Tomyam soup tasted similar to the one I had in Bangkok. Would recommend to any Thai Food lovers!,Jessica Chua
Jai Thai,4,Food is consistently authentic and flavourful. It is however disappointing that they cannot afford serviettes. They used to have tissues at a central table which diners have to take themselves. Now even that is no more. I have to think that I have paid cafe prices and got coffee shop service.,Angela Chua
Jai Thai,5,Hidden gem in the neighbourhood serving authentic thai food!! Aroy Mak Mak!,Angela Goh (Mummy Angela)
Jai Thai,5,"I recently stumbled upon a Thai restaurant while searching for a lunch spot, and I was pleasantly surprised by the food. Although the portions were a bit small, the prices were very affordable.  I tried the salted fried rice, a platter where the prawn cake was the standout, and the clear tom yum soup—though I asked for it to be less spicy, it still packed quite a punch but tasted delicious!  For dessert, I had chendol and red ruby, both rich in coconut flavor and very enjoyable. Overall, the food was flavorful, affordable compared to other Thai restaurants, and definitely worth the visit.",M F
Jai Thai,5,"Authentic Thai food, worth to order - green curry. Set lunch menu (individual  group) available",Manli Y
Jai Thai,4,I liked the Kang Kong and green curry. I didn’t like the basil chicken,Elijah Lim

Jai Thai,4,Affordably priced authentic thai food. Food was slightly salty but the portion and ingredients was generous. Highly recommend pandan leaf chicken and platter. Tom yum soup was flavourful with 5 pieces of prawn.  Definitely worth a try!,Zhi Le Tan
Jai Thai,4,"Very hidden n secluded restaurant which is more for the landed area. Happened to find as i was looking for thai food in the area. Limited parking and i was lucky to get 1 within 5 mins. Probably around 10 lots max n i guess. U need to park further or at those industrial buildings nearby.  Old rustic feel which hasn't been renovated for years. Chairs felt abit shakey due to age i guess.  Ok for the food. Misses for the prawns which was hard and not fresh. Beef was just as bad due to the hardness, dry and sad feel. Will skip these 2 if i order again.  Prawn cakes, pandan chicken and Sotong were very good. Thumbs up for these. Fresh tender and nice. Omelette was nicely done as well but then again, rarely do you get this dish wrong isnt it.  Service was good and it seems most were thais. Very crowded on this Sunday evening, full house in fact.  Price wise - indeed as per what their signboard rave but also do note of the portion size. Its mostly on the small size.",Ars 3276
Jai Thai,3,Quite nice Thai food and reasonable price...,Ho
Jai Thai,5,"Never disappoint me. Always forgot to give review as the restaurant is near my office.  For the past two years, their standards maintain. And I have also brought many friends there too. Don’t be mistaken by the simple look of the dishes. Today I decided to take photos to post as I really appreciate them always letting us order food when we reach almost at 830pm and the restaurant will close soon.  Food is always tasty and love the Tom yum with lots of original ingredients.  Have tried all their desserts also yummy.  Tang hoon texture is great and with lots of ingredients too.   Please keep up the standard.",A T
Jai Thai,1,"Food very poor quality- its only redeeming feature is not so expensive. However there are much nicer places at similar price. Beef was tasteless and quite chewy, cashew chicken was mushy mess not crispy or tasty, nothing good to say about fish, green curry was too creamy and sweet.",Carl Ward
Jai Thai,5,"Food's always great at Jai Thai, authentic thai food at very affordable prices.",rach t
Jai Thai,4,Limited parking space and also tables in the restaurant. Weekend dinner peak hours expect longer wait time (my own experience was a 35 - 45 mins wait for food after orders are sent at 7pm). Otherwise they do delicious thai food at reasonable prices. Staff are friendly and responsive.,BERNARD CHUA
Jai Thai,5,"Amazing food, nostalgia from childhood. That says it all really.",Austin Seck
Jai Thai,2,"decently priced food albeit the portions were small. The service was horrendous though. We practically ate each dish individually and had to wait quite a while for the next dish to be served. To top it all off, the pad thai (our main source of carbs) came the last……….. came here expecting a quick dinner and got served fine dining instead.",christopher foong
Jai Thai,5,"Awesome food, truly enjoyed it. One of the best Thai food I've ever had. Thank you. Will definitely come back.",S K Selva
Jai Thai,5,"Food at Jai Thai is amazingly delicious and service is wonderful.  It does not allow you to sit there too long during lunch-hour because of lunch crowd, however - enough for you to have a meal and go.",Teacher Ryan
Jai Thai,5,"Love how there was ample space between each seating area. The service was great, everyone was friendly and clarified any questions we had. Food was delicious, green curry a tad sweet, tom yum soup was great ! Both were set meals, green curry was upsized, so was the rice that came with it. Good portion for 2. The fried egg was crispy and fluffy upon serving. However the mango sticky rice was not what we expected. Rice was not as fragrant as we had hoped for. The milk tea was your standard yummy Thai milk tea. We also ordered a Ruby red drink, pretty refreshing with coconut milk and coconut water with thin slices of jackfruit in it. This was part of the set whereby you had to add on $2. Overall, very satisfied with the meal and price point.",Raven D
Jai Thai,2,"Food is too salty, all my hair might fall after this meal... $8-9 for a plate of pad thai (egg shells included), not worth the visit",Bryan Chan
Jai Thai,5,Quaint space and serving delicious Thai food! Will return in the future! Recommend the Pandan wrapped chicken   prawn spring roll   Tom Yum soup!,Discoverable lzy
Jai Thai,5,"Came for their vegetarian menu, wasn’t disappointed. Food wasn’t very oily, pleasant home-cooked taste, three portion sizes to choose from. Pretty well-done vegetarian dishes. Spent $38 for 2 pax. Came at noon, place wasn’t packed so we did not need to wait for a table. Staff were friendly and helpful. A small gripe is that parking is very limited. We will be returning customers.",Anata Suki

Don’t have to wait long either for the food to arrived and it’s not too crowded so it’s nice to have dinner here in peace.  Staff is friendly even though there’s only 1 of them waiting the either floor.  I would say the Tang Hoon is especially delicious, the rest of the dishes ordered such as the Tom Yam, pandan chicken, stirred fried beef and basil are decent.  Total damage was ~$60 for 2 pax",Jie Ying

Jai Thai,4,"Very decent Thai food for its price. Used to be cheaper and came here a lot when studying at a school nearby. Prices went up since 2017 but the food is excellent. The Thai Beef green curry is a must get, so is the basil sauce fish fillet. It is closed from 3-6pm so take note. Recently they seem to start taking reservations, so if you have a big group might want to call earlier to get seats. The Thai milk tea and lemon grass drinks are very nice!",Oscar Lee

Jai Thai,3,"Main selling point of this restaurant is the relatively low price. Food was mediocre, way too salty and my tongue had the MSG tingles afterwards. Desserts were a saving grace though, mango sticky rice was yummy and so was the red ruby. Ok to grab a quick bite, but certainly not a nice fancy place with its white fluorescent lighting and white walls. Clean though !",Chin S

Jai Thai,1,"Was there on Fri night. Crowd was decent, with few empty tables. Ordered 4 dishes (tomyum soup, red curry, Kang Kong and basil squid in chili sauce)  Waited about 15 mins before first 2 dishes finally arrived (squid and Kang Kong). Rice almost finishing and the last 2 dishes didn't arrive. Give reminders but seems like no use... Waited about 20 mins still no order was served. Decided to cancel our last 2 dishes. Half the people in the eatery were already done with eating so I'm not really sure why the 2 dishes needed to take so long to arrive. Doesn't make sense to wait 20 mins in btw meals for dishes. If you need customer to wait long period please inform the customer upfront, they can decide if they are keen to wait. Not make people eat halfway and wait.",JJ YY
Jai Thai,1,"The queue was unacceptable, the food does not even look good and they don't respond to customers request, left before even entering because my blood was boiling",Liew Yang
Jai Thai,2,"Localised Thai food still tasty and edible. Common popular dishes found in malls. Does not taste, smell or look Thai at all. Prices are cheap at the expense of quality produce, mostly frozen stuff and processed that tastes inferior. Not for those seeking authenticity.",Jiahong Yow
Haci'nin Yeri - Yigit Lokantasi,5,We went to Marmaris with my wife for a holiday. We chose this restaurant as a place for dinner based on the reviews and because we wanted juicy food. When we first went there was a serious queue. You proceed by taking the food you want in the form of an open buffet. Both vegetable dishes and meat dishes were plentiful. There was also dessert for those who wanted it. After you get what you want you pay at the cashier. They don't go through cards they work in cash. There was a lot of food variety. And the food prices were unbelievably cheap. We paid only 84 TL for all the meals here. It included buttermilk and bread. But unfortunately I can't say it's too clean as a place..,Gulsum Akar
Haci'nin Yeri - Yigit Lokantasi,4,During my holiday in Marmaris we ate here to fit the food. It's really good that the food is cheap and nice. Eating as much bread as you want is a big plus for those who are not satisfied without bread. It is a place that I can recommend to those who will go to Marmaris. On July 1 there was a small increase but even the price hike is cheap. I leave the photo of the latest prices and breakfast below. there was a serious queue.

Pizza Fellas,5,The ambiance of the place is nice; when we went; there was a lot of queue; and after waiting for a while; they took our place.

Kafros Pizzeria,2,Staff were quick but surly. the service was actually fast; i can't afford it.

Coming to the wage issue; there were prices that did not match the prices of luxury restaurants.,Tugay Sari
Kafros Pizzeria,4,I think it's a nice place. Pizza was also nice; but a little expensive. I liked their sauce.,Omer Kaya
Kafros Pizzeria,1,First of all; the atmosphere is nice; but there should be a solution for flies in the open air; such as fans that blow water.

Salih Usta,1,Have you ever seen a rainbow in these colors?! The 5-year-old boy would draw the umbrella more beautifully; which was said to be made of sugar dough. The cake doesn't even stand up straight. A birthday cake would only be so sloppy.,Hasan Erdem

Salih Usta,5,They have various and delicious products. Especially the age cakes are very successful. The materials they use in the products are of high quality; the prices are reasonable according to the quality.,Fatih Ege

Mado,3,There is no need to tell Mado at length; it is a clean and beautiful place.  But there is no standard; kadayif burma with pistachios used to be so unique that I would like to eat it everyday. But now sometimes it was burnt; sometimes dry; sometimes uncooked.,Melike Gulsen
Mado,5,Well; it was very nice; the service was very fast and the prices are reasonable; I recommend delicious food.,Ali Berk Kustul

Mersinli Cigerci Apo,3,Although it is not as much as an urfa; it is the only place that can eat liver under samsun conditions. Appetizers can be improved. There should definitely be green mint next to the liver; arugula does not suit the liver.,Hayrullah Unal

Baskent Aspava,2,The sauces and uncooked meats of the dishes give the impression of a meal prepared in the mall and not in a kebab restaurant.,Gun Oksay
