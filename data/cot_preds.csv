"I worked in a famous seafood restaurant in Singapore where 90% diners came for chilli crab. Came to try chilli crab in Todak and we asked for 800-900gm crab. But when it was served, it looked much smaller than the requested size. It looked like 650-700gm only. I'm very certain they cheated on the weight of the crab.",1,0,0,0

"Went for lunch today , ordered a crab and a red leopard grouper with 2 bottles of beer . Total coat RM415 for 2 pax . Crab was terrible wrong due to only shell and not fresh , is totally not from what i picked from the display tank . Fish was ok taste and no complaints. Not the first time visit but this might be the last time . Totally disappointed and not worth the time and effort travel there for such a dishonest restaurant.",1,0,0,0

"Don't spend your money HERE ! ! Paying superior price and get super low quality food. Don't order crab here! - crab meat with slime - shell is big, once open up meat is smaller than anchovies - crab probably dying soon or already dead Told front desk about it, they dont even bother to explain,  only ask me how I want to make payment! Spend RM410 for 2 pax lunch ! Sucks food, bad experience, no service at all !!  Will update my review if I have any food poisoning issue",1,0,0,0
"Been many times, but my recent visit just 2 weeks ago was a big disappointment! The crabs , 1 piece were nt so fresh, the fish was bad, as it was overcooked n texture was rubbery! The Live prawns were NOT fresh at all as it was not caught live from the tank whn we were there! Very dissatisfied n disappointed!! We feedback to e staff and they were totally defensive and dismissive, rather than offering an attempt to understand or address the issue. There was no effort made to offer an apology or a form of compensation which made our experience more frustrating. When we asked for some compensation in e form of some discounts on our total bill, the reply we got was , “We r just workers, the boss is not around”!

Was a little unsure about the reviews but was glad we made it. We arrived when it was low tide and as one other reviewer mentioned the garbage is exposed and the place looks dilapidated and filthy. However the restaurant itself is actually pretty clean including the toilet. The pricing is very reasonable and transparent. The seafood is very fresh and tasty. I did find the seasoning a little too heavy but overall happy with everything. Will love to return.,1,0,0,0
"I recently visited this restaurant. A spacious and clean seafood restaurant that serves no pork and no lard, making it suitable for a wider group of diners.  The restaurant is located slightly inside the area, but it's worth the trip. They have a wide variety of live and fresh seafood to choose. All the seafood are market price. Freshly catch and will be weigh in front of you.  The food was great as always, which is why I visit regularly. I especially enjoyed the Teochew steam fish and soy sauce prawn. Prices are average and reasonable for fresh seafood.  Staff were friendly and attentive and service was good.  A great place for seafood lovers—definitely recommended!",1,0,0,0

They don't use digital weighing scale to weight ur seafood and they weigh with the pail. so not very accurate.

"The road leading to the restaurant is kind of rough. Have to drive slowly as there are pod holes along the way. Food is nice. We ordered baby kailan, drunken prawn and 2 medium size crabs.

The sauce is more watery. Taste kind of like tom yam. Drunken prawns are fresh. Customer service was OK. Atmosphere is OK. The restaurant is on a platform stretches out into the coastal area. Pricing is OK.",1,0,0,0

Went with some friends. Really enjoyed the deep fried sea bass. It was so fresh and tasty. Also enjoyed the spicy prawn dish (forgot the name). The prawns were succulent and sweet.

"What we had:  Lunch Set (11.30am to 5pm) - Starter, main dish and drinks - $17.90  1. Tom Yum Seafood Pasta Visual: 4.5 5 Taste: 4.5 5 Creamy, spicy, and tangy — the taste and quality have been consistent for years. This is my go-to dish every time I’m here. I’ve tried tom yum pasta from other places, but this one’s my favorite. The amount of seafood is impressive too — I’m not even a big seafood fan, but I always manage to clean my plate. Chef’s kiss. Nothing bad to say about it :)  2. Cheesy Chicken Chop Visual: 4.5 5 Taste: 3.5 5 Generous portions — the plate was bigger than we expected! Lots of crispy fries and coleslaw to go around. Unfortunately, the chicken sauce tasted more like pizza sauce, giving it a pizza-on-chicken vibe. It lacked depth and the “wow” factor was mostly from the portion size. We probably wouldn’t order this dish again.  3. Cheese fries (ala carte $9.90) Visual: 4 5 Taste: 4 5 Looked awesome and tasty! Best to share with more than two people — we couldn’t finish it all and appreciated that the restaurant was happy to provide takeaway boxes. It’s a bit pricey, but when shared among a group, the cost is manageable. Plenty of sauce, both cheese and mayo — loved it!  TIP: Visit during their lunch hours for the set meal — it’s definitely worth the price then!",1,0,0,0

"What's to say, but the utopian buffet experience can only be had at the Ritz Carlton Sunday champagne brunch.  From fresh seafood to curated cocktails, you'll be sure to get a bang for your buck if you visit on Sunday for their brunch. Most buffets claim spreads, but the Colony Sunday brunch promises quality of the spread.  Only here can you get bespoke service, where they encourage and entice you to try their 3 cocktails, 2 champagnes, red and white wines, and at least 4 fruit drinks, including the different waters from sparkling to distilled. And if you're lucky to get NingNing, you've won the lottery for the day.  She's the Sunshine of the Colony, and brings you warmth and a personal touch that makes you feel like you've got your personalised butler service. Don't worry about changing plates, or getting wet ones, or cutlery to dig out the delicious crab. She'll get them for you, and with a smile.  Thank you, Ning Ning, for a memorable brunch.

"Airy, upscale hotel eatery with 7 open kitchens, plus a la carte meals & a generous global buffet. The Colony buffet at the Ritz-Carlton is generally considered a top-tier buffet experience in Singapore, known for its diverse and high-quality food, elegant ambiance, and attentive service. We were invited for dinner by a friend of ours. Loved the ambience  service and food. Two guys at the Pasta section ,took good care of my dietary requirements when I told them make Ravioli for me. They were careful about not adding onions and garlic etc I liked it. The guys at the Pizza section didn't want to make any pizza when I requested for a vegetarian one,not sure what’s the point of having a live station catering to diner's needs. They just pointed at a few slices on display which didn’t look appetising, so I moved to Pasta section. Desserts and fruits were fresh. At the other sections, food was being replenished in time. Indian food section was untouched,looked full except diner going for mutton and tandoori chicken. Couldn't take photo of the food,will capture it next time. As a vegetarian who doesn't take onion and garlic,there were some options for me like salads, breads, pasta etc. Couldn't find any vegetarian soup as both the soups which were available had meat in it. Loved the architecture. It is wheelchair accessible. Buffet Dinner at Colony (Sundays to Thursdays) Available from Sunday to Thursday from 6 p.m. to 10.30 p.m.The dress code is Smart Casual. Slippers and activewear are not permitted. Covered shoes are required for gentlemen. Thank you for the top tier dining experience.",1,0,0,0

"Came here for colony. The deco first of all is amazing but the food is even better Hands down the best hotel buffet I’ve tried in sg The range of food is huge , amazing choices and There are so many foods ill recommend Some of the best are squid ink pasta, the beef, the buns , and seafood , desserts Some say laksa was good I found this to be average only but also not too bad At the price point definitely worth Heard that there will be lobsters at dinner session, will come back again for this .",1,0,0,0
"I have booked in advance before the trip for a great meal on Singapore's trip, and the food was as satisfied as expected. But when the employee who took my card when I calculated, I didn't come back for a long time, and I didn't try to meet with me even though I passed by many times in front of our table. Eventually I requested another employee and received a card and receipt. Overall satisfactory, but at the end, I was rude and unpleasant.",1,0,0,0

"First time trying this place, recommended by friends. We purposely came on Friday night where they served seafood buffet. Understand Sun-Thurs may have some 15% discount for certain credit cards, but no discount on Fri and Sat.  Basically, there are 3 main section of food, the desserts, the cold dishes and the cooked food (together with fruit juices and fruits).  I must say the selection of food is great, but considering the price per pax vs quality , I give it a 4-star only. Some of the food item is quite disappointing, such as the lobsters, al of us concluded the sauce taste funny, and we had to specially asked for it without sauce. The oysters and crabs are fresh though.  The environment is nice and cosy, but t think they placed too many tables, resulting in the walkway between tables are narrow and can be dangerous when you move with hands full of food. I give it a 4-star.  The staff are friendly and helpful but they lack some product knowledge, and we had some trouble checking on discounts, and almost needed to avoid our payment. 3 of us paid $425 Plentiful of parking at the hotel car park and they give complimentary ticket.",1,0,0,0
"Went for buffet lunch today and I must really praise all the staff for their top notch services and attention.The Colony's atmosphere is good, not noisy even though is full house and space in between tables is not cramp. Though the buffet ended at 2.30p.m., the staff allow us to sit till 6p.m. before their dinner commencement. Really appreciate their kind gesture and thoughtfulness.  The international buffet has a good range of dishes to choose from. The cold prawns and crab are really fresh likewise for the sashimi. If you like ""hum full"" laksa, this is the place for it. Lemak gravy which has the old school taste. Thanks for the good experience today. Reservation recommended.",1,0,0,0
Had a great experience at Colony today buffet lunch! Was served by Saidu with customer centric service. He surprised us with the birthday cake when we asked for a group picture. He was very sincere when attending to us and take special notice of our birthday celebration. Kudos to Saidu and team!!,1,0,0,0
